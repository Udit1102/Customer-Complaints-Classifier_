But she kept with the pushing and using the typical collections as to scare me and try to get me to pay something that made no sense. I spoke with my sister who has a career in collections/compliance and I allowed her to get information regarding this debt as I did not want to speak with the extremely rude and unprofessional individual, XXXX XXXX. My sister called NRA on XX/XX/2018 and gave my phone number to locate the account. She was quickly transfered to another department ( never verified who was on the phone ). Once transfered it was the same lady I had spoken to at an earlier time. My sister informed me she was rude and could have spoken in a different manner as far as professionalism. Not once during the 20 minute call did she ask is this was XXXX, or verify in any other way. The only information was that a women on the phone that had my number to locate the account in the office to get information on the account. My sister was able to obtain all of the information on the account and was in complete shock that they never verified. NOT EVEN MY NAME! At the end of the call she asked to be transfered to the manager and the agent said "" are you trying to catch me in something '' and she stated to just transfer to the manager. The manager got on the line and started to speak on the account and then I informed the manager that the rep not once verified who was on the phone. She then realized that she ( the manager ) should verify and FINALLY asked if I was XXXX XXXX. NOPE she was not XXXX XXXX and told the manager that a CFPB and XXXX  complaint will be filed due to giving out all account information to a third party without verification."

I contacted them asking for a tracking number and this multi-million dollar company told me they just slapped a stamp on the sucker and hoped for the best. No tracking, no confirmation it was even sent, nothing. I asked how they could do that and the rude woman on the phone told me they'd do that even if it was a XXXX check and said if i wanted better I should have pre-paid for a XXXX label. This option was NEVER given to me. If it was, I would have taken it in a heartbeat. Instead, I am being forced to go back to the insurance company, request a new check, draft a letter stating I never got the the check, mail it all to them again and hope that history doesn't repeat itself. I asked to speak to a supervisor but was instead transfered to a voicemail box. I never received a response. I emailed twice, no response. I love how a mortgage company could lose your payment check with no repercussions, but if they lost mine I would be hit with late fees and interest from day one."

So, I gave them the auto loans, credit cards and student loans that I have open. They then asked me to give them the same information for accounts from the past. I have not had any of these type accounts for over 10 years and I do not remember the names of mortgagers or finance companies I had products with. After spending all this time answering their questions ( 15 minutes ) they then say they can't help me because they can't verify the answers I provided! This is the third time in the last two years they have done this. The end result is I can not correct the bad credit rating they have on my account because they are using information that is likely wrong to determine if I am who I say I am.

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,Unknown,"This complaint is concerning an FHA Fixed Rate Loan Program with VanDyk MortgageCorporation for an amount of {$270000.00}. Van Dyk Mortgage failed to inform us of the deadline by which we must be under contract which has caused us to be seriously damaged. XXXX XXXXXXXX, provided us with a preapproval letter XX/XX/XXXX and another one XX/XX/XXXX. In an e-mail from XXXX XXXX, she stated that our loan must close by XX/XX/XXXX because of the expiration of one of our children 's qualifying benefits on that date XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout this entire process, XXXX XXXX had indicated that the treatment of my student loans would change XX/XX/XXXX, and that we must be under contract no later than XX/XX/XXXX. We have been pursuing the purchase of a home with that time frame in mind and had no problem with being under contract as of XX/XX/XXXX, and had received an initial encouraging response on one of the properties. XXXX XXXX called us at XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, informing us that we now had to be under contract that day because the change in the treatment of student loans was occurring XX/XX/XXXX. Initially she left a voicemail, voicemail transcript or recording can be provided. She then spoke with my husband and gave him the same information. It was impossible to complete any negotiations with the holders of the notes and mortgages by the endof the day. The next day she sent us an email stating that we were approved fora mortgage for the maximum amount of {$170000.00}. The change in treatment of student loans is something that was known in the mortgage industry in XXXX of this year, and it was VanDyk 's responsibility to know this information and properly inform us. Had we known that the change would occur XX/XX/XXXX, we would have timed our negotiations to meet that date. Now we will not be able to purchase a home that is satisfactory for a family with XXXX children. We contacted another Mortgage company and they were able to preapprove us for {$150000.00}. That is a difference of XXXX. We are asking that VanDyk mortgage make up the deficiency that was due to their own error. We hired a lawyer, XXXX XXXX, to contact Vandyk Mortgage because after talking with BillVering, the branch manager, he would not contact us back as he previously promised. XXXX XXXX wrote a letter to Vandyk Mortgage, which costed us {$900.00}. Vandyk'sresponse contended that they were not in error in their failure to disclose important dates that would affect the amount of money that we could borrow. XXXX XXXX did inform us that it would take approximately $ XXXX to take this case to court. As itstands now we must find appropriate housing for our family, and we do not have the money it would take to litigate with Vandyk Mortgage. Regarding Vandyk 's response to the demand letter : The Van Dyk attorneys were concerned about our ability to pay for any mortgage, yet they approved us for {$270000.00} initially, then {$170000.00} after the FHA guidelines pertaining to student loan debt went into effect. Even when XXXX XXXX contacted me on a personal level to try to hire me as a worship leader for a church conference event, she at no time mentioned any concern for my loan or the ability for my wife and I to pay for a loan from Van Dyk mortgage.Ultimately the response letter from Van Dyk Mortgage discussed different issues that were irrelevant to what actually happened that led up to this point. They concede that they did indeedwait until XX/XX/XXXX XXXX to tell us that the rules were changing on how the FHA was going to consider student loans. They maintain that in failing to disclose important dates and asking us to be under contract by the end of business that day, within 6.5 hours, they did nothing wrong."

The deferment ended XX/XX/XXXX which is when COVID began and I started making phone calls asking for a loan modification which was denied but I was told if I brought my loan to being less than 90 days late I could get a COVID protection which I then struggled and made a lump sum payment on XX/XX/XXXX so that I could be approved for the COVID protection and defer my payments with a balloon payment at the end being one of the options I could choose. I was on COVID protection until XX/XX/XXXX. During which time I kept in touch with Chase and asked several times what would happen at the end of the COVID protection and if a balloon payment or extra payments added onto the end of my loan was still an option and I was told several times that was options. Now in XX/XX/XXXX I am being told by Chase that I am not approved for any type of balloon payment at the end of my mortgage or putting the payments on the back end of the mortgage because my loan was not current when I started the COVID Protection, the reason I was not current is I had a deterrent due to the tree falling on my home. I was not told that it was something I had to get approved for I was told it was something I could choose to do. I am now being told I dont have any options except to pay the 18 months of missed payments up front or in a 6 month payment plan or sell my home. I just want the missed payments during the COVID protection put at the end of my loan in either a lump sum or missed months added on in months at the end like I was told I would have the option to do."

I have disputed with the company and with the bureaus and nothing has been resolved.

They charged off a balance as per the response in the amount of {$49000.00} back in XXXX 2011. Realtime resolutions then starts to report the account starting at 180 days past due. Not a collection account but an open account with a balance of {$63000.00}. Also a past due balance being different than the current balance. How is that even possible? If the first company charged it off then why is the second company showing late over 180 days. By the looks of my credit report they just charged it off last month. How can they hold a charged off account from one company for over 5 years then charge it off again? Then to make matters worse XXXX XXXX XXXX shows in the payment history as having a balance of {$49000.00} as of XXXX. This seems to be a huge scam! It appears as though 2 mortgages were charged off.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Barton Creek Auto d/b/a XXXX in XXXX, Texas. I was told by XXXX XXXX the account representative that I should be careful about mileage because "" this is a lease and anything over 20,000 miles per year would cost me {$15.00} per mile ''. It even said so in the paper work so I acknowledged that I understood. She mentioned to me that if I wanted to get out of the lease early, all I would have to do is pay {$490.00} early termination fee and turn in the car. OK. I saw that in the contract. No problem. 

Fast forward to today. I do a LOT of driving and I was getting close to the 20,000 mile per year limit. So now its time to BUY a car which I can drive freely instead of LEASING a car and having to worry about mileage. 

I went to another car dealer to see about purchasing a car and the dealer called XXXX XXXX of Barton Creek Auto d/b/a XXXX to confirm it would cost me {$490.00} to end the lease. She told them no, it would cost me a whopping {$1900.00} to get out of the lease, even though the lease agreement clearly stated {$490.00} to end the lease and return the car. 

Barton Creek Auto d/b/a XXXX told me something entirely different when I chose to exercise my contractual right to END THE LEASE. XXXX XXXX told me that she is charging me .XXXX  cents per mile for the miles I have driven on the car since I leased it. 

THAT IS NOWHERE IN THE CONTRACT. There is no mention of a .XXXX cent per mile charge. She said she is "" being nice '' by charging me these extra fees of {$1900.00} instead of the {$490.00} stated in the contract. 

Barton Creek Auto d/b/a XXXX is in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Their written contract states {$490.00} to end the auto lease and the company representative creates a new story and thousands of dollars in additional fees when I decided to exercise my contractual right to end the lease."

We sold our house in early XX/XX/XXXX, and moved my family ( XXXX young daughters, XXXX wife, and myself ) into my parents basement for XXXX  months while our new house was being built. 

In the meantime, I called all of my service companies ( cable, power, security, etc. ) to let them know about the move. They were all great, with the exception of XXXX. The customer service rep said I could just take the equipment since it was basically paid for and contact them when we move for new service. They informed me that they would suspend service since we werent under a contract and we could reinstall at the new residence. 

During the in the basements months while we were awaiting our new house to be built, XXXX constantly harassed me to pay them, saying I broke a contract - which I disputed even existed. Finally, I spoke to a supervisor who said they would handle it and I shouldnt be bothered again. They apologized and said they hope Ill consider using them again once I move. 

I thought it was taken care of until I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from Tate & Kirklin Associates , Inc. sent to my parents address, informing me that we owe {$730.00}. 

This is a bit outrageous, as we were current with our payments ( never missing even one ) when we moved. I was informed we didnt need to worry about this and it was an erroneous item from XXXX XXXX"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I have filed SEVERAL complaints over the past year against XXXX XXXX auto loan. I totaled my car and my insurance company sent them the amount of the worth. There was still a balance of {$5000.00} due. I was SEVERELY effected by XXXX and lost many of my clients because they either went out of business or couldn't afford marketing anymore. After my loan came out of forebearance I still could not afford the $ XXXX/month payments. I called them and asked if there was any way to lower the monthly payments or keep me on forebearance and they said no they didn't offer anything and I had to pay the {$560.00}. When the first payment was due I still couldn't afford the payment and called again. They then refused AGAIN to work with me in any way to lower the payment or offer any XXXX relief. I started saving as much as I could at this point but it was a struggle. They then started posted late payments onto my credit score which lead me not even to be able to take another loan out to repay them. I then made a {$300.00} payment in May to show that I was trying but then they posted yet another late payment onto my credit score. I file a complaint with the CFPB about this and get a call from some named XXXX from the "" Office of the President ''. Every time I try and call XXXX back at his extension I never get him and it leads back to a rep who just wants to get me to pay. He then leaves a letter reply on my complaint saying that they want to work with me and call. I call and then get told by another rep that there is NOTHING they can do for me and I have to pay the amount. I then file ANOTHER complaint and again XXXX replies to call. I call and his extension is fake and I get ANOTHER rep saying they can not do anything for me in regards to XXXX relief and I have to pay. 

I then get a letter in the mail saying that my account was in closure and that I had to pay the full amount immediately. Not knowing what this means I call and speak to a rep. They tell me that I have to pay {$270.00} to keep it out of closure. Never explaining what closure of the account even means I thought I was okay since I recently paid {$300.00}. I file another complaint with the CFPB and then get a call from XXXX about it. I try and call her back the same thing happens all over again! I can never reach her and a rep tells me their is nothing they can do for me and I have to pay the full amount of the loan back. I tell them that I cant even afford the monthly payment and how can they expect me to pay the full amount. I then get a call from "" XXXX '' from the office of the president and actually get to speak to her. She then tells me she is escalating the case and then I get a call from "" XXXX '' and she leaves me an extension. I try and call her extension and the SAME THING happens all over again. When I hit "" 1 '' to leave her a message it goes back to a rep that tries to force me to pay. This is like a GAME they are playing internally. Its a run-around in regards to dealing with my CFPB complaints! Yet they continually are posting late payments to my credit report which is killing any chance I have of getting out of debt."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Hello, Equifax continues to violate FCRA and many other federal and state laws. 
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a consumer reporting agency like Equifax violates section 1681 i ( a ) ( l ) if it fails to do a reasonable reinvestigation when a consumer disputes "" information contained in his file. '' Collins v. Experian Info. Sol 's , Inc., 775, F.3d XXXX, 1335 ( 11th Cir. 2015 ) ( "" [ a ] file is simply the information retained by the consumer reporting agency. "" ). 
I submitted a dispute on XXXX for XXXX XXXX  Acct # XXXX and inquiries. Equifax provided dispute results XXXX ( 5 days later ), stating acct was verified as accurate. Is that possible? Was a reasonable investigation done? 
I filed a dispute on XXXX for XXXX XXXX  Acct # XXXX and inquiries, dispute results were ready XXXX ( 3 days later ) acct verified as belonging to me. Is that possible? Was a reasonable investigation done? 
The FCRA is intended "" to protect consumers from the transmission of inaccurate information about them, and to establish credit reporting practices that utilize accurate, relevant, and current information in a confidential and responsible manner. '' Cortez v. Trans Union , LLC, 617 F.3d 688_, 706 ( 3d Cir. 2010 ). Despite the dispute Equifax received from me, Equifax has completely abdicated its obligations under federal and state law and has instead chosen to merely "" parrot '' whatever its customer states. Equifax 's failure to investigate disputed account information is a result of its standard policies and practices adopted in reckless disregard of consumers ' rights under the FCRA."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Back in XXXX of 2022 I reached out to all 3 credit bureaus plus the creditor which is XXXX XXXX. XXXX was successfully able to dispute and block the fraud account which is XXXX XXXX BUT Both Experian and XXXX still refuse to remove it. I am a victim of Identity fraud and i sent all providing documentation verifying that. The credit first account is not mine. I am not liable for any transactions made by this account nor am I responsible for this account. I AM TELLING YOU AS A CONSUMER TO REMOVE, BLOCK, AND DELETE THIS ACCOUNT INDEFINETLY AND DO NOT PLACE THIS ACCOUNT BACK ON MY CREDIT FILES. Per 15 USC 1681b "" the person who procures the consumer report on the consumer for employment purposes shall provide to the consumer, by oral, written, or electronic means, notice that a consumer report may be obtained for employment purposes, and a summary of the consumer 's rights under section 1681m ( a ) ( 3 ) 1 of this title '' THE COMPANY HAS NEVER SENT ME A VAIDATION OF DEBT THERE FOR THE ACCOUNT MUST BE REMOVED."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"We started loan modification process with Bank of America in XXXX XXXX. Trial period was scheduled for XXXX months XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. After that if we paid as requested are loan would be modified. 
During trial period we received letters from Bank of America that we are late paying our loan, which made no sense to us because we paid everything on time. We contacted loan modification department XXXX times after receiving late notices but every time we were told to disregard these notices because all payments were made before due date Timely payments were actually requested in order to qualify for the loan modification by Bank of America. 
Loan modification was approved by BofA in XXXX XXXX. 
Couple months later we asked XXXX Bank to modify another equity line of credit and were shocked when told that we have XXXX late payments on our loan with BofA. Our credit scores dropped around XXXX points. 
When I reached to BofA they advised me to file a complaint with credit bureau and their banker told that she had this same problem with her loan medication. 
I filled a complaint with XXXX and received their response XXXX XXXX. They said they contacted BofA, supplied them all relevant information and documents I sent with my dispute and instructed them to : review all information, verify the accuracy, provide response and update records and systems as necessary. 
After response from XXXX XXXX called BofA twice. First time in XXXX was told that they will investigate my dispute and notify me. Second time on XXXX XXXX, XXXX when after being on hold for XXXX min customer service representative told me that I have a wrong number ( number was from our statement ) and connected me with someone responsible for equity lines. This person told me that reporting was correct because we were making payments requested by the loan modification department which were different from original payments. She also told me that our loan modification processor should make us aware of that. From the bank point she said everything was done properly. 
From my point it 's a nonsense. Why we should be penalized so severely XXXX credit scores down XXXX points ) by BofA for modifying the loan? Why we were not notified before starting trial period by BofA that our credit will be so negatively impacted? We would be glad to continue paying original payments and modified payments to avoid ruining our credit and have problems applying for credit in the future. 
We still waiting to get a response in writing from BofA regarding our complaints."

They did not credit me for the first payment ( phoned in check # XXXX ), and were using my second payment as my first, and my third payment as a second payment. The fourth payment was also not credit to me and it was not until they received my fifth payment that the modification was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately this left me 30 days behind, when I really was one month ahead. 

I have filed several complaints and they appear to have found my payments but have credited me less than the amount due. They claim I now have a credit of XXXX when I should have a total credit of XXXX. They have not been very clear on why I even have a credit. My suspicions are they have found my payments, but are deducting all the late charges that should be completely removed, since I have never been late with my payments since the modification. I provided ample proof of all my payments, and they have both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX payment history and their own. I 'm also puzzled why they claim to have completed a new modification on XX/XX/XXXX ... Why?

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"I have been deffering my property taxes fo 10 years. First with Nations star ( took over XXXX XXXX XXXX   loans as I recall ). As provided by Texas law. And now the loan is with Mr. Cooper. 

For some unknown reason Mr. Cooper paid all of the accrued property taxes ( in error I assume of {$69000.00} ). They indicated they had contacted XXXX county to get a refund because of the error and XXXX county advised it would take 60-90 days to respond. 

In XXXX they informed me they would have to raise my payment from {$1300.00} to {$3100.00} ( {$1700.00} ) I assume to reimburse them for their error. I can not afford that, the reason I was defferring taxes. 

I complined about the action and they responded. And after talking to several representatives. They advised me my payment would remain at {$1300.00}, and the XXXX statement reflected that amount. I have a response stating that amount. 

Today I recived a new statement dated XX/XX/2019 due XX/XX/2019 and the escrow account is $ XXXX. Back to the original problem.. 

My loan number is XXXX. 

I am concerned as I am on a fixed income and can not pay the additional {$1700.00}. 
Why should I be penaalized for their incompetence? 

I understand that everything will be paid when we sell the house and or the owners are deceased. 

Your help or advise would appreciated.

Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"This is now the seventh time I am reaching out about this same issue. There is a remaining balance on the credit card that DISCOVER closed because I had filed a dispute for identity theft against them. Remove and delete the remaining balance. There was no reason to close the card as I had exceptional and on time payments on the card for XXXX years. As a result, I got cut off from credit that I had been using to make several everyday payments that I was no longer able to make because my credit card was closed. 

Because every extension of credit originates from my social security, also known as my open end credit plan, I am the original creditor of every extension of credit and debt obligation. Therefore, I am deferring the debt back to DISCOVER who is misrepresenting me, the original creditor. DISCOVER claiming that they are the original creditor is XXXX, XXXX, and misrepresents me as a natural person and the original creditor who is giving DISCOVER life as a corporation. 

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1692, "" means other than misrepresentation or other abusive debt collection practices are available for the effective collection of debts. '' Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1692a, "" The term 'debt ' means any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment. '' Notice, debt is an "" alleged '' obligation. To "" allege '' means to claim as true with or without proof. 

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1692a, "" The term 'consumer ' means any natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay. '' Again, as my social security is where all credit extensions and debt obligations originate, I am the original creditor. I am now deferring the debt back to DISCOVER. 

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1692k, "" Except as otherwise provided by this section, any debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter with respect to any person is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damage sustained by such person as a result of such failure ; '' As DISCOVER has violated me, deceived, and abused me as a consumer, original creditor, and natural person, they are liable to compensate me for the violations made. Congress protects me under these laws as a natural person against corporations who abuse consumers like DISCOVER. 

Please remove the remaining balance from my account, report positively to consumer reporting agencies about the deleted debt, and compensate me in an amount equal to the sum of damages done to me."

Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",Unknown,"This is my second complaint about Seterus Inc . Approximately 4-5 years ago when my loan transferred over to Seterus they did not accept the accelerated mortgage payoff program which was I was enrolled in. My mortgage payment was deducted from my account two times per month rather than just once which helped pay down the interest faster. Seterus never sent me any written correspondence advising me they did not participate in this program and six months after they were so called "" servicing '' my loan they sent me a late notice ( which was a first for me ). They explained over the phone my loan payment had been late for the previous six months because they did not accept electronic payments ( despite getting only one late notice ). They explained my bill payer service was having to cut a check and mail it to them every month. This explanation did not make sense because I was scheduled to make the second final monthly payment well before the due date around XX/XX/XXXX and they were explaining they were n't getting my payment until almost 30 days later. I did not realize it took almost 30 days to mail and receive a check. This businesses behavior to me was suspicious and since this took place without any notification for a long period of time I no longer trusted them. I have a paper statement sent to me and will not partake in electronic statements. I have my bill payment provider cut a check to them half a month early ( just in case ). In the recent past I spoke to about XXXX different individuals who could not explain a discrepancy on my escrow ( which has yet to be resolved ). When requesting a full escrow analysis was advised they only give that out once a year and I would have to wait until the next time around. I was also told to send a request in writing or fax it, so I sent a faxed in letter to the number provided, called back several days later to confirm they received it and was advised they could not tell me because they did not have access to the faxes. When I asked to speak with someone in escrow they explained they do not have phones and did not accept emails and the rep told me they had all been fired in escrow due to "" issues '' ( she then said she should not have told me that ). Fast forward to my current issue, I am simply trying to find an address to send my principal payment to. This should be a simple process ; however, last time I sent a principal payment we had to call to find my payment because it was not posted until approximately 30 days later. They gave an explanation of "" principal payments need to be sent to a specific address '', however, this address is not listed on any of my monthly statements or their website? Also, when I call them ( usually around XXXX to XXXX XXXX pacific time ) the answering service states I have reached them outside of their hours of operations and to call back later, but on my paper statement they list hours of operation being M-Th XXXX to XXXX and F XXXX to XXXX ( all pacific time ). This is the worst creditor I have ever had to deal with. I believe they try to be misleading and manipulative with information. I am very disappointed that nothing has been done to correct their bad behavior and poor customer service performance. Since the beginning I have not been able to trust what they tell me when they explain problems, there is usually not much effort put forth to try and resolve problems and now I feel I can no longer trust the information provided on my mortgage/escrow statement. I just want them held accountable for the incorrect information they have on my statement and the information that should be on the official website or statement like principal payment address."

No note or knock on the door. I tried to call but they said I had to call back during business hours it was a holiday. I had to cancel my appointments for the next day and go a night without vital medications not knowing where my car was. The next day I was told I had to pay XXXX to get back a car I was making payments on. At their mercy I paid this got the car back but was blocked from the portal or seeing any of the info that was there. They debuted the wrong account and blamed me for it and took the car over that payment. Then charged it off on my credit report but I still have the loan and the car and everything they stated on my report is not factual. It was never on my report until they did this shady deal. Now Im stuck and cant do anything. This company scams people all the time then locks you out of seeing your account info. How can you charge off a vehicle take it without notice or filing an affidavit but make them pay to get it back and you still have the same loan company XXXX. Something has to be done especially because I was working with them and notifying them of everything.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Unknown,"In late XX/XX/2020, from my home in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX I began the process of applying for a mortgage to buy a home in northern XX/XX/XXXX. I had a banking relationship with Chase and after some research on rates and costs decided to get prequalified with Chase before looking for properties and then working through the application process. Since I was between jobs having retired a year earlier from the XXXX XXXX XXXX  and about to return to work at the end of XX/XX/2020, the loan officer suggested using our assets as the basis for a loan rather than wait for verification of my reappointment as a XXXX XXXX XXXX. That seemed reasonable even though it was not fully explained how detailed the documentation process to verify our assets would be. Nonetheless we managed to comply with an endless stream of requests to help the underwriters verify our assets and provide the necessary documentation. After we verified the sales contract on our house in XX/XX/XXXX we set a closing date for XXXX XXXX, a month away, and had our realtor send a copy to the loan officer so that the mortgage could be approved and in place in time for the closing scheduled to take place in XX/XX/XXXX. We locked in the rate with the understanding from the loan officer that by moving more of our assets to Chase, we would qualify for discounts, bringing the rate from 3 % down to 2.6 % with no prepaid points. In order to qualify we went the through the process of moving assets to Chase with assurances that we would receive the lower rate and everything would be in place in time for the scheduled closing. When we departed for VA a few days prior to the closing we were assured by the Chase loan officers that everything needed for the scheduled closing was in place but when we arrived there we were asked to provide yet additional details about our assets. We were also confronted with some new requests that we pay off some of our credit card balances ( something we do every month anyway ) and not use our Chase branded credit cards until after the closing so as not to trigger any additional credit rating reports. We also learned upon arriving in VA that the settlement company had received nothing from Chase and that it was unlikely that the closing could take place on schedule as we had planned. Despite furtive attempts to contact Chase and get the information from the lender to the settlement company, we were unable to close on the property as planned and faced the likelihood of us defaulting on the sales contract. We were unable to get any response from Chase other than a phone message apologizing for delays with underwriting and a promise from a Chase loan supervisor to look into what happened. We subsequently withdrew funds that we had moved to Chase in order to qualify for the discounted loan and paid cash for the house, not what we had intended to do but forced into this situation by Chase failing to approve the loan in a timely manner and communicate properly with us. Ironically, we discovered upon our return to XX/XX/XXXX, Chase sent the documents approving the loan via US mail not at the promised discount interest rate, but at the original rate of 3.00 % which was not what we had been promised and which arrived to us after we had closed on the property. We feel that we have been badly misled by Chase about the process, victimized by a bait and switch in terms of the interest rate promised, and but in a very compromising position legally and financially by not being able to come through with the expected financing when it was required. I have been contacted by someone at Chase 's Executive Office two weeks ago and have been playing phone tag ever since. Its clear to us that the processing and communications at one the nation 's largest banks is terribly deficient, poorly supervised, and grossly irresponsible. We were warned by our realtor about the challenges of dealing with large banks and the benefits of working with local lenders. We had thought that our relationship with the Chase branch in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX would assure good customer service, advice and support. It seems that we were wrong."

I was charged {$25000.00} for this vehicle even though it's retail value was les than {$15000.00}, and this was through their in house financing company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They also hit me with a XXXX  % interest rate. They did tell me after a year of payments I had the option to refinance or upgrade to another vehicle. At the time it was the height of the pandemic, our other car had broke down, we had just gotten over XXXX, and my wife was due to have a major XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. We didn't have a lot of other options so they pretty much used that against us. There was about {$2500.00} worth of repairs that needed to be down on the vehicle and they had wrote me out a "" We Owe '' statement saying these issues would be fixed. After purchasing the vehicle XXXX XXXXXXXX auto Connection kept the vehicle basically through XXXX and some of XXXX saying they were trying to fix it and use their "" warranty '' so that they weren't out of pocket for fixing it. They didn't fix the major issues because they didn't use their in house service center, they sent the vehicle to a service center XXXX  miles away that was some oil change place. The only thing they did was change the cabin filter and put a new brake caliper on the front of the vehicle. By this time, I had already had to borrow a car to take my wife back and forth for XXXX appointments and for the XXXX stay after her XXXX. XXXX XXXX basically told me there was nothing else they were going to do to fix the vehicle. The vehicle needed new headlights because they were melted on this inside, new wheels and tires because rims were bent, a new rear axle shaft, new brakes, calipers, rotors in all XXXX wheels, and a new blower motor. I ended up having to pay for and do all this myself. I eventually filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they basically made XXXX XXXX write a check to me to pay all the parts. Since then, I have only missed XXXX  payment due to having XXXX and an agreement was signed with XXXX XXXX XXXX to remedy this. Other than that, I haven't been late on any payments and always paid in full. I have had to make a XXXX  of arrangements and their financial department likes to play games and pretend to forget arrangements had been made. So fast forward to now, I need to shop for another vehicle. I got to another local dealership and they say they can't help me due to what XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been reporting to the credit bureau. I looked at my credit reports and it shows that you have a XXXX  % interest rate and pay $ XXXX monthly for this vehicle. It also shows that I have missed/they haven't report over half of my payments. This has completely destroyed my chances of getting another vehicle that I desperately need and I'm fairly sure XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX did this intentionally so that I wouldn't qualify to refinance for a lower payment or interest rate and that I'd have to keep paying what I currently pay ( $ XXXX  monthly ) for the next XXXX  years. I have payed in almost or right at {$14000.00} to this company and all they have been doing is putting most of my payment toward interest. I still show to owe them {$18000.00}. The vehicle XXXX XXXX and trade in value is less than {$10000.00}. I no longer want to deal with this company and it seems like what they did to my credit history. this is a willfully violation of my rights under the FCRA and I will seek legal counsel and it damages if need be"

My credit has now been run 3 times for this loan. The 3rd time on XX/XX/2021 without my authorization. This is now a hard spot to be in. They have dragged me on so long I can't go to a different company because of the recent increase in rates. I have been paying additional interest on a loan with a higher rate when I was suppose to be closed over 100 days ago. I am not sure at this point if my loan will close. This is such a waste of time to deal with company. I have not signed my documents because of the large increase in closing costs. I emailed everyone that I have dealt with on XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX quickly after receiving my new documents and have not received an answer. At this point I want my loan closed.

Claiming there is an alleged debt when the Bill/note was destroyed by way of securitization therefore fully discharging all debt between parties according to U.C.C 3-604 ( a ) A person entitled to enforce an instrument, with or without consideration, may discharge the obligation of a party to pay the instrument ( i ) by an intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation, or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out of the party 's signature, or the addition of words to the instrument indicating discharge, or ( ii ) by agreeing not to sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a signed record.

Experian stated my account was verified but how is that possible if they did not do a proper investigation according to the law. Also every piece of information on these accounts are still not reporting 100 % Accurate. 
And according to the FRCA 15 USC 1681 everything has to be 100 % Accurate. I have the credit report showing the inaccuracies. 

It is XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to receive a response from XXXX and XXXX. By law they are required to respond within 30 days of receiving my dispute. And as you can see in the pictures I sent my letters via certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX! 

As you can in the attachments that XXXX is reporting the same account from two different collection companies. How can I owe two companies for the same account? How is that possible? This is an error and these accounts must removed. 

In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting act. The List of accounts below has violated my privacy and confidentiality under 15 USC 1681 15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A. States I have the right to privacy.

15 U.3.C 1681 Secton 604 A Secton 2 : in also states a Consumer reporting agency can not furish a account without my written instructions 15 U.S.C 1881. ( a ) 5 ) Section States : no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the Items of information or Any other adverse item of information other than records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than

seven years. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 XXXX XXXX XXXX A perso
n shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency This company stated these accounts were verified as certified by the company reporting it. According to the FCRA that is NOT a legal form of validation. As you can see it was one
account XXXX XXXX  was removed from TransUnion because it is inaccurate. Ive never ever had a signed contract with XXXX XXXX for any type of consumer account. Ive yet to receive any signed contracts from any of these companies that are reporting this information. I want these false accusations and accounts to removed from my report. I did not give any company to report this false information on me. 


This company is also reporting that in XX/XX/XXXX my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX is current. However in XX/XX/XXXX This company has me reporting as 90 days past due. How is that even possible when there is not even 90 days between XXXX and XXXX? 

It is illegal for this company XXXX XXXX  to randomly and inconsistently report this erroneous account as a XXXX and this credit bureau report it to my report. This is ILLEGAL! This information is false and reporting inaccurately and needs to be removed.

He then told me to XXXX the Equifax number and call them. I called Equifax at XXXX, but was told I need to contact XXXX for XXXX questions. I called that number and was told to call XXXX. When I called that number, the system told me that it was outside business hours, told me I could leave a voicemail and then hungup on me.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"We signed a contract to build a home with Taylor Morrison Home Builders on XX/XX/XXXX We chose to use their financing and trust their inspectors. They showed us several lots within the development that we liked and we chose a lot that was larger and listed for {$10000.00}. This lot is included in the contract. We went through a disastrous design and build process ( see letter attached in Step 3 ). Our questions during the process were met with total indifference and/or contempt. When it came time to appraise, the appraisal came in {$25000.00} below our purchase price. Taylor Morrison refused to acknowledge a problem. We met with their mortgage team, the sales department heads, among several others that did not acknowledge any issue and put the burden on us to make up the difference. They eventually gave us roughly {$2500.00} back in the purchase price but failed to explain how they made the difference of that amount up given we did not bring any more to closing, and our monthly payment did not change. At the final walk through of the home, I was asked to sign a paper saying that I acknowledge receipt of the landscaping and lawn in good order and they were not responsible for any dying grass or shrubs, etc. I asked to see the yard before signing. As we were walking the property our construction Superintendent ( XXXX XXXX ) left siting childcare issues. I never signed any document nor did we finish our final walk through as the house had to be locked. Once we moved in, I noticed immediately during the first rain that the yard did not drain properly ( see attached images ). The plan calls for water to move off the property however it ponds and does not move from the back. This has caused the grass to die, and hazardous conditions for our pets and selves. Mosquitos, fungus, bad odors all inhabit the yard. Taylor Morrison claims that the grass is not warranted, and there is nothing they can do about the yard holding water. They claim it is per the plan and refuse to determine why the water ponds. XXXX XXXX stated that our property was a "" swale '' and that water ponding for 72 was totally acceptable. In all of our conversations with any representatives of Taylor Morrison, no one mentioned a swale, we did not acknowledge that our property is a swale, and it is inconceivable to me that they will not acknowledge the problem. During the entire process, we feel misled. There were serious misrepresentations that took place and the warranty program is a continuation of this pattern. They claim to be "" the most trusted builder '' however our experience is much different."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"Hi, I closed on two loans on XX/XX/XXXX. First a Conventional Loan unwritten by Fairway Mortgage ( https : //www.fairwayindependentmc.com/ ) and other was HELOC by XXXX XXXX. In the entire process, I as a buyer was talking only with Fairway. The loan officer at Fairway was coordinating the HELOC loan with the other company. 

My concern is about the fees and Cash-to-Close for my house at XXXX XXXX XXXX. Cash to close communicated to me till XXXX XXXX was {$170000.00}, but I ended up paying {$170000.00}. The difference of {$960.00} came as a surprise to me, which I am not happy about. I had been asking for a final XXXX for a week before closing, and I expected to pay the fees that was in the closing disclosure given to me. 

I have raise this concern with the loan officer and their manager, but they are saying they can not do anything. 

My concern is not that I paid more than I should have. My concern is that I paid more than I was told to pay. The Loan officer was my single point of contact, and a day before closing he confirmed {$170000.00} to me and his Closer, but $ $ went high on me. 

What is the point of closing disclosure and all the communication when a Loan Office can not give final XXXX right before the closing date? 

Thanks, XXXX"

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

The complaint is as follows : XXXX, XXXX, Transunion, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX are all in violation of the CARES Act, by erroneously reporting a late payment, from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and refusing to allow me to dispute it. I contacted both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, regarding being directly affected by Covid and created a payment arrangement. I honored my payment arrangement by paying XXXX XXXX in full and by making a payment amount on XXXX  XXXX. I was told to send a request in writing and to then dispute the erroneously reported information to the credit bureau. To date, neither company has corrected my credit report, nor have I been able to dispute the erroneous information with any credit bureau or get the erroneously reported late payments removed. I am a XXXX veteran that had a current account with no late payments or delinquencies, at the onset of covid-19. This erroneous reporting has caused my credit score to drop nearly 75 points. This is in direct violation of the CARES Act which states : If your loan is considered current ( not past due ) at the time you make an agreement with your creditor to modify repayment, the creditor needs to report to the credit bureaus that you are current on your loan. If your loan is considered delinquent ( past due ) when you make an agreement with your creditor, your status will continue to show as delinquent until you bring the account back into good standing. Once you bring the account current, the creditor must report your status as current to the credit bureaus. According to the new law, an "" accommodation '' could be an agreement to make partial payment, to put a loan in forbearance, to modify a loan or to offer any other relief. The CARES Act protections require creditors to follow these guidelines for all agreements made between XX/XX/2020, through either XX/XX/2020 XXXX 120 days after XX/XX/2020, when the law was enacted ), or 120 days from the date the COVID-19 national emergency is declared over. 

Despite this, Transunion has not corrected my report. Their response was that no such accounts appear on my credit report and to check it again. This is completely inaccurate as the accounts are in fact on my credit report as XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Just for my own information, I purchased my Transunion profile from XXXX, and the inaccurate delinquencies are still there. This is a violation of the FCRA and is unacceptable. These inaccuracies caused my credit score to plummet and has completed disrupted my plans of purchasing a home."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"THIS COMPLAINT IS IN REGARD TO INACCURATE INFORMATION EXISTING ON MY XXXX/XXXX XXXX CREDIT REPORT. THIS COMPLAINT IS AGAINST RISE AT THIS TIME. 
This is a complaint arising under Sections 5 ( a ), 5 ( m ), 13 ( b ), and 16 ( a ) of the  Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTC Act ), 15 U.S.C. 45 ( a ), 45 ( m ) ( 1 ) ( A ), 53 ( b ), and 56 ( a ) ; the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x ; and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692-1692p, to obtain monetary civil penalties, a permanent injunction, restitution, disgorgement, and other equitable relief for the Defendants violations of the FCRA, the FDCPA, and Section 5 of the FTC Act. 
RISE provides consumer personal credit reports to regional and national credit grantors, attempting to issue both commercial and consumer credit. RISE regularly furnishes consumer credit reports to Creditors electronically. RISE is an entity who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more Creditors about its transactions or experiences with its consumers. 
RISE routinely receives complaints from consumers who claim they do not owe the debt or that an account is invalid or incorrect. In numerous instances, I have notified RISE at the address specified for such disputes that RISE is reporting inaccurate information concerning my consumer credit. As a victim of identity theft I expect the information in my consumer report to be accurate and my disputes taken seriously. 
RISE has continued to report inaccurate information to the Creditors even after receiving such notice and accompanying proof. In numerous instances, I have disputed the information appearing on my consumer credit report in writing to RISE. RISE receives most notices of disputes from a consumer in electronic format, through automated consumer dispute verification ( ACDV ) forms provided on RISE S website. 
Pursuant to Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the FCRA, RISE, as a furnisher of information to the Creditors, is required to conduct an investigation of the disputed information upon receipt of a notice of dispute from a Consumer. For certain types of disputes, such as those where the consumer claims the account is not his or hers or belongs to someone with a similar name, it is RISE s policy and practice only to compare the name, social security number, date of birth, and address in RISE s computer database with the information provided on ACDV forms. Where three of the four items match, RISE will report to the Consumer that  it has verified the information it furnished as accurate. It is RISE s policy that only after the consumer has alleged the same type of account inaccuracy more than four times will the  matter become assigned to a supervisor to do further investigation. Because RISE collects accounts that are often old, information in its computer files may not be accurate for a variety of reasons, including incorrect updating of addresses, errors in recording names and information, and problems with the original Creditors records. 
In disputes involving identity theft or fraud allegations, RISE s policies provide that if the existing account codes and notes in its records do not contain any reference to a prior claim of fraud, RISE will verify the previously reported information without conducting any investigation prior to such verification. In numerous instances, despite written or oral notification from consumers disputing the accuracy or completeness of alleged debts, RISE continued to furnish the information to the Creditors without communicating that the information was disputed by the consumer. Section 623 ( a ) of the FCRA describes the duties of furnishers to provide accurate information to Creditors. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) prohibits furnishers from providing information relating to a consumer to any Creditor if i. the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate ; and ii. the information is, in fact, inaccurate. In numerous instances, I have contacted RISE at the address specified by RISE to dispute information furnished by RISE to a Creditor and to notify RISE that the information is inaccurate. 
In numerous instances, I have also provided information such as the consumers drivers license, social security number, and/or proof of residence to confirm my identity. The acts and practices alleged above constitute violations of Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) of the  FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ). Pursuant to Section 621 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s ( a ) ( 1 ), the acts and practices alleged above also constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5 ( a ) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45 ( a  ). 
Under Sections 13 ( b ) and 19 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 53 ( b ) and 57b, I am able to recover all equitable and ancillary relief as it may deem appropriate in the enforcement of the FCRA, the FDCPA, and the FTC Act, including the ability to order rescission or reformation of contracts, restitution, the refund of monies paid, and disgorgement to deprive a wrongdoer of ill-gotten gain. 
Section 621 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s, authorizes a Court to award monetary civil penalties of not more than {$2500.00} per violation for each violation of Sections 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) and 623 ( b ) of the FCRA. 
I want RISE to remove these inaccurate items."
Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"Since this company took over my loan after I refinanced, it has been nothing but headache after headache. After assuming my mortgage not only did they make it more difficult to pay my bill online by trying to get me to agree to illegal servicing fees that they are currently in a lawsuit with 33 states for illegally charging their customers, after signing up for auto-pay to bypass this fee, they now are not accruing for my payments accurately stating i'm past due on payments, when I have bank account statements stating I've made payments. I called to report this error on XX/XX/XXXX after I saw the payment removed from my bank account, but XXXXHH portal showed me as past due. I spoke with PHH agent XXXX ID # XXXX who assured me my payment was processed, but could not explain why the payment amount I submitted was under 'Other ' vs capturing the additional payment I made towards my principal amount, nor did he know why the app and website showed me as past due and late on my payment. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX after not hearing from XXXX, and spoke with XXXX ID # PGA, who informed me XXXX was still looking into the issue, and would followup within 24-48 hours, and that the payment was not applied correctly but to rest assured they would fix this. I have a low-level of confidence in a company that has deceptive practices that don't allow good customers who pay their bills on time to trust it will be processed in an efficient and effective manner. We're now going on to call three with them for an automatic payment process that should not cause this many headaches & hope their faulty payment system doesn't accidently cause a customer to default on their mortgage because of a system error on their end. I demand for PHH to stop these deceptive practices and implore the CFPB to investigate this company especially given recent lawsuit activity in the deceptive practices they are subjecting their customers to."

My bank information was given to them and I authorized them to proceed with automatic debits for the payment of these items. 

The problem is that within the 3 days of the contract, I didn't have any problems, but about a week later, the water that came out of the filter, had a bad tasting and smelling water. I called the company and they said I have to change the filter. I told them the filter is supposed to be brand new, I shouldn't have to change the filter yet. They told me to contact the manager but he was not present at the moment. 

With that experience, I didn't want to open the box that contained the second item, the air filter. I got a distrust feeling regarding this Company. 

I emailed the company, explaining to them my problem with the water filter and offering to return the items because I didn't want to keep paying a big amount of money for low quality items. They told me they can ' t take the items back and kept sending me the bill with the accrued interests.

I was told : "" You have no credit reporting. '' My reply was : "" I have a mortgage that I 've been paying on for twenty years. "" "" Whomever has your mortgage is not reporting any payments. '' was her reply. 
Upon returning home, I checked my XXXX credit scores. Green Tree Servicing has never reported any of my payments. 
Upon calling Green Tree Servicing, I was routed to a half dozen different people before some really rude woman came on to tell me that I had never filed a reaffirmation with XXXX after my bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX and because of that, they were not required to report my payments to the credit scoring agencies. 
I had filed bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX while still a customer of XXXX Mortgage and sent them a letter assuring them that I wanted to reaffirm with them, I had never missed a payment until I requested a Loan Modification from XXXX. The Loan Modification was completed and granted in XX/XX/XXXX, two years after my bankruptcy. 
With XXXX continuing to take my payments and granting a Loan Modification in the aftermath of my bankruptcy, they effectively accepted my reaffirmation,. 
In XX/XX/XXXX Green Tree bought my mortgage and stopped reporting, Now they want me to go to court to reopen my bankruptcy and do a reaffirmation with them, before they 'll begin reporting again. Three years after they bought my mortgage, they tell me this. 
This is effectively holding me as a financial hostage, because XXXX XXXX XXXX is no longer reachable. 
Now if I want to get any credit at all I 'm stuck, with only my mortgage payments as proof of my credit history. I hate being strong armed."

The Federal Trade Commission agreed years ago that the debt collection business is broken, and now, because of a loosely held Supreme Court decision, the debt collection industry has gone off the charts on illegal activity of the transfer of trade for personal credit matters. Each of these violations where proof of ownership is not sustained is a serious breach of an implied agreement between the collection agencies and the credit bureaus through the subscriber agreement between the parties. Your credit reporting agency needs to investigate this abusive practice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) must initiate a serious investigation on this abusive practice. My files should be purged permanently as the fraud has already been committed, and I am subject to my rights to sue for damages. 
I am one of millions of American consumers who has been entwined into a scam by various collection agencies in America. Attached is a document known as a qualified written request or QWR. There are several posted collections on this QWR, all with account numbers backed by copies of collections from XXXX XXXX. On each of these collection notices it specifically states that XXXX XXXX is the new owner of a debt or debts that were originally with another creditor. However, a fully completed QWR on each of these debts will prove that not only is XXXX XXXX the new owner, but that any transfer would have been illegal unless said transfer came from a securitized trust agreement. All of these debts were sold off into a trust, and the QWR for each debt will prove so. Now Ill explain how this scam originated in the United Stated over the past year. 
On XX/XX/2017 a decision was handed down in the United States Supreme Court on a case called XXXX ET AL XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This 11-page decision comes right to the point on the application of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the rights consumers should have under this act, and the tracking of new ownership. This decision left a window open for the debt collection agencies and their counterpart original creditors to pass off charged off debts without the proper documented trail. The decision states that a buyer of debt ( s ) can work outside the FDCPA protections guaranteed to consumers. 
The problem is becoming a giant problem pertaining to trade rights for Americans who should be protected under FDCPA. Im making the claim that each and every one of these collection has perpetuated a fraudulent activity that should be beyond a civil complaint, but more criminal in nature. 
XXXX XXXX has never acquired these debts legally. There was no tracking of the debts from originality to a securitized trust, and from a trust with multiple signatures to XXXX XXXX. This process is not only fraudulent, but a process that has caused me great damage to my personal credit history. This agency is now doing this process to virtually millions of Americans amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in fraudulent collections. 
COLLECTION AGENCY HAS NO SUBMITTED PROOP OF OWNERSHIP! 
A COPY OF THE XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX IS ATTACHED! 
I DEMAND A FULL HISTORY OF OWNERSHIP BASED ON A QWR! 
I DEMAND THE PURGE OF MY FILES FROM XXXX XXXX. 
TO EACH CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY, XXXX, XXXX  AND TRANS UNION RESPECTIVELY : A scam is being presented to each credit reporting agency in millions of cases. The Federal Trade Commission agreed years ago that the debt collection business is broken, and now, because of a loosely held Supreme Court decision, the debt collection industry has gone off the charts on illegal activity of the transfer of trade for personal credit matters.

Upon receiving the report I noticed that it had a collections account on there with a balance of {$60.00}. There are two things here that bothers me and has now stopped me from purchasing a home for me and my children. First, this account was paid in full and it should never have gotten put on my credit report from the beginning. Second, although I paid the account I never received a notice from ACCOUNT RESOLUTION CORPORATION COLLECTION AGENCY stating that they were putting this on my credit report. If I'm not mistaken. According to the FDCPA I must be notified within five days of a collection agency putting anything on my credit report. That was not done.

I reached out to all 3 credit bureaus and they are saying that the information was verified accurate. In which, they have not sent me anything showing how they got their information. Nor how this inaccurate account is showing verified as accurate. 

Therefore, at this time I am asking that you please have this paid account DELETED from all 3 CREDIT BUREAUS. I DO NOT WANT IT JUST TO SHOW COLLECTION/PAID BECAUSE IT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN PUT ON MY CREDIT REPORT. IT WAS PAID IN FULL BEFORE IT WAS PUT ON THE CREDIT REPORT. AS WELL I NEVER GOT ANY NOTICE THAT YOU ALL WAS PUTTING IT ON THERE. 

This is really stopping me from securing a home loan for me and my family. 

Respectfully, XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information is missing that should be on the report,"I filed a complaint with the XXXX  regarding my Capital One/Walmart account because Capital One was failing to accurately report the correct balance, so in response Capital One chose to delete the entire account tradeline from XXXX  on XX/XX/2020. I called Capital One and on XX/XX/2020 and spoke to a supervisor XXXX and he said that I would need to contact the XXXX  to make the correction when Capital One is the party that requested the deletion. My account has been paid in full and I have been waiting for my credit report to reflect that and was wondering why my credit report didnt look right. It would be really nice if Capital One went the extra mile for the consumer especially during this national pandemic and these very trying times when consumers are facing difficult hardships. The credit bureaus only report what the creditors instruct them to report as allowed by law and Capital One should be more cooperative and provide more assistance to their consumers in time of need. 

Please investigate this matter as soon as possible as time is of the very essence as this is having a negative impact on my overall credit score.  I want and need this tradeline added back to my credit profile effective immediately and Capital One will not cooperate with me as usual. I am attaching a copy of the dispute report from XXXX  to show the before and after to show that they in fact had my tradeline deleted."

Debt collection,Credit card,Taking/threatening an illegal action,Attempted to/Collected exempt funds,"My name is XXXX XXXX, a mother, XXXX of over fifteen years, and honest citizen. This is an URGENT Mississippi action where a company is trying to collect on a six year old alleged judgment that was never agreed to or filed in court. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Midland Funding , LLC attempted to collect on a credit card debt by suing me. The case was released. However, the company, or their lawyers, NEVER got the judge to sign a judgment, nor was a judgment ever filed in the court. I called the court for copies of the documents several times to see if I had a judgment ; there is still no filed judgment! Because the judgment was never filed, I did not make any payments to the Midland. This company, then, fell under scrutiny and was sued by multiple persons - I was asked to join the suit, but declined. The company immediately fell under and was dismantled. As such, I definitely made no payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX contacted me and my job alleging I owed a balance and they were going to execute a garnishment. I researched the issue and verified that in Mississippi debts must be collected within three years. I had not been in contact with the company since XX/XX/XXXX. So, I responded in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Act. In that response I neither acknowledged or affirmed the debt. I asked them to stop writing me and my job because they lost their chance to collect because it had been over six years. 

They continue to write me and my employer. The company continues to threaten me, and recently they have "" found '' a signed document that was still never filed. I am afraid and embarrassed by their illegal attempts. My employers are afraid and contemplating releasing me. I have been a nurse for over fifteen years, and I am a pretty great nurse. I also love my job. I am a single mother of XXXX, and I acted responsibly in handling this matter."

Which is ridiculous - as the representative could not even tell me which hospital this is for. 

I called and spoke with their office on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX XXXXXXXX @ commonwealth. I asked for some proof that this is infact my debt he was unable to provide me with the basic information necessary. He told me, "" to think about possible hospitals I have visited in XXXX. '' How is this possible? 

I then contacted the credit agencies to advise and they are telling me this is a valid debt. How is this possible? They can't even confirm the original creditor? or hospital? Please help me. 

thank you, XXXX"

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"On XX/XX/XXXX I renewed my mortgage loan with XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas. The majority of this renewal was done through email. I was sent the renewal documents which I had motorized and returned in XX/XX/XXXX. As you can see on the documents, the balance of the loan was {$60000.00}. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I had a text message exchange with XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX about missing a payment on the loan. It was also getting closer to the next payment being due as well. The text conversation is about making these 2 payments. I made the 2 payments in XX/XX/XXXX. The documents provided to me by XXXX XXXX clearly shows these 2 payments. I missed the next payment for XXXX XXXX. I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Leaving me 1 payment behind. I made 2 payments in XX/XX/XXXX. I was unaware when making the 2 payments in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that the additional payment was not applied to the delinquent payment but to the principal of the loan. 
Mr XXXX would send me text from time to time letting me know when I needed to make payment or to check the status of making a payment. Covis - 19 begins in XX/XX/XXXX with the shutdown of everything. 
At this time I know I am 2 payments behind on my mortgage. 
Mr XXXX begins to push for me to to "" revamp '' the loan and move the missed payments to the end of the loan. I have been making the monthly payments at this time but not making any progress on getting the 2 outstanding payments paid. I am being charged over {$200.00} XXXX late fees every month at this time. XXXX 's idea to redo the loan is pushed to me with the fact I would not be paying the additional late fees anymore and the foreclosure process would not be started by XXXX XXXX. This is in the shutdown due to covid19. When I mentioned this to him and the difficulty of earning income his reply was basically, "" the is issue began before covid '' I agree to the loan modification in XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I am emailed the documents to sign I see that the amount to be adjusted {$4100.00}. I am only 2 payments behind at {$2200.00}. 
I contact XXXX XXXX. I ask about the amount of {$4500.00} and am told I am 4 payments behind. I disagree and ask for a history of payments since the loan was renewed in XX/XX/XXXX. Upon looking at the documents I see the loan balance shows {$79000.00}. 

Here is the primary reason of my complaint. 

I signed renewal documents, signed by a notary, and filed with the XXXX county clerk with a balance of {$60000.00}. 

When I let Mr XXXX know there was an error in the balance shown and what I signed, his response was : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX "" Have no idea where you are getting the XXXX number. Your note was renewed on XX/XX/XXXX balance was XXXX Send me a copy of what you are referring to. '' Why he would respond this way was surprising to me. He had the paperwork that was notarized and signed by me on file, and the exact same paperwork filed with the XXXX XXXX clerk. 

I sent him the documents he ask for. 
I got this response on XXXX XXXX "" Will send this to Real Estate Department they do the renewals. This was not your principal balance at time of renewal per our records. '' I responded : "" Where would they come up with that number. And I never saw another closing settlement document in XXXX. So how did that happen without my knowledge? '' XXXX reponse : "" No idea but the number is wrong does not match with the amortization schedule '' I respond : "" So I am assuming they just went in and changed the amount owed and didnt have a closing settlement document? 
Maybe the amortization schedule is wrong And I'm still showing that I am only two payments behind according to my payment record from my bank '' I didn't sign the revamp of the loan due to the I correct balance. 

I don't hear anything from Mr. XXXX so sent him a message XX/XX/XXXX trying to make a payment on the loan. 
We discuss the difference in how many payments I am behind. I say 2 he says 4. When I ask home to look at XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and the additional payments I made in those 2 months, the payments being applied to the principal and not the missed payments, I get no reply or feed back to my request. To date Mr XXXX has never responded or commented on these 2 payments. I am being charged late fees every month over {$200.00} but I can't get my loan officer to even acknowledge my request for a review of those two months. 

I didn't sign the modification. I start making an additional payment with my mortgage payment to get caught up. 

I get this message from Mr XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX : Mr. XXXX, Will take a look at your loan tomorrow after the payment made today is posted. It will take 4 payments of XXXX to advance the due date an extra month. The extra amount being paid is approx. {$300.00} per month with your regular payment being approx. XXXX it will take some time for the loan to be current. 

I respond : Can you please look at XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I had made 2 payments in those 2 months that were applied to the principal and not the payment that was behind. If you apply them to the payment that were behind, and after today 's {$1500.00}. That would leave me just 1 payment behind.

I do not hear from Mr XXXX again until XX/XX/XXXX I am still paying over {$200.00} in late fees every month. 

When I do hear from Mr XXXX it is to inform me on the delinquency of my loan or that he'll my escrow is behind schedule or about possible foreclosure. All the while I'm making current payments with the additional {$300.00} to try to get caught up on the loan. I don't hear anything about the discrepancy in the balance of the loan or the additional payments I had made to bring the loan current so I don't have to pay the late fees anymore, the ones that I've been paying now for over a year and all because mr. XXXX doesn't want to go back and change the amount paid to the balance to the delinquent payment. 
A lady named XXXX XXXX was helping me each month with my debit card payments for the loan. She was not allowed to have access to my account, even to possibly help me get those payments changed to the delinquent payment instead of the balance of the loan. Again getting current and having the late fees stopped. 
Mr XXXX has not provided an response to the the discrepancy in the balance I signed on the last disclosure statement to the balanced a show on record he has not provided me with any information in regards to this problem. And I stated before he has never given me any feedback on the two payments. 

I'm XX/XX/XXXX I finally got caught up. 

Still no answer to the balance discrepancy. 

And no reply from Mr XXXX  about the two payments being applied the proper way to stop the late fees. 
However he did contact me several times about redoing the loan again. My assumption is that by renewing the loan he could get the balance back to where he thought it should be and there no longer being a discrepancy in what I signed and what the bank has as the balance. 

I see this as fraudulent and deceptive. I believe Mr XXXX knew of the balance issue, the disclosure statement I signed and had notarized is available to him at his bank location when I brought up the issue. He wanted to get me to redo the loan so he could eliminate the discrepancy without me ever knowing there was one. which is why he would not go and review the two payments so he could pressure me to redo the loan with the assumption that I was 4 payments behind instead of 2 and he could threaten foreclosure and escrow issues which he did. And doing so when the country is going to the covid-19 pandemic and I being self-employed was drastically affected by the shutdown XXXX XXXX was acquired by Bancorp South recently. 


There still is a balance issue And the issue of having to pay late fees on an account that wasn't past due 4 payments but for 2 payments.

I have text messages exchanged between me and Mr XXXX along with emails. 

I am attaching a copy of the paperwork that I had notarized and is on file at the bank and at the XXXX county clerk 's office. And the payment history provided to me by Mr XXXX. 

I can provide copies of all the text message exchange and email exchange between Mr XXXX and I upon request."

Person threatened my credit and made up false explanation for why a false debt was just now being collected on after 6 years. I called former bank of which the debt originated and they verified this was false. Person was named XXXX XXXX and claimed they had done a federal background search to find me. The number I was called from was XXXX.
Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"Loan number:XXXX What happened? 

XX/XX/XXXX I signed for a heloc loan which was due paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. or refinanced by XXXX XXXX. because of the financial crisis of XXXX XXXX XXXX merger with national city and pnc bank . I was told to not worry about the XXXX due date and just keep making the payments because they could not find my loan documents and that I would get a new document with a new date for me to sign. I went to my branch a few times to refinance or get information way before the loan due date of XX/XX/XXXX and I was told not to worry just keep making my payments which I did. In all this time I have never been delinquent or asked for a loan modification or any hardship assistance or benefits. I have never been delinquent or late on my first mortgage or my heloc second loan with pnc bank. This loan was for 10 years they have never sent me any documents or paperwork with a new loan due date. In XX/XX/XXXX bank letter I received a letter from pnc saying that my heloc loan borrowing period was ending XX/XX/XXXX and I have 3 options, refinance, pay the balance or may be eligible for other repayment options and I would receive a notice with a change of my minimum monthly payment due. I was never told in writing or verbally that the full loan payment was due now or the urgency involved. I then went to my pnc branch and spoke to XXXX she told me I could not use the credit line any more and my interest and payment would go up monthly that i was better off refinancing the loan for a lower interest rate and monthly payment instead of continuing to pay the higher amount. I also had called the bank and spoke to a few more people looking at what finance options I have the answers were all different. In XXXX I spoke to the pnc loan officer XXXX and filled out an application because he sounded more knowledgeable and gave me better information and options to refinance or get an installment payment loan and had explained to me all my finance options. I filled out the application and submitted it. I was denied because of serious delinquencies on my heloc loan and the loan was closed and in default triggering my bad credit score. That is impossible because I have made all of my payments on time. Loan officer told me this is why my loan was denied and I had a hard inquiries from pnc that also lowered my credit score. I also for the third time asked for copies of my heloc loan and he requested them but I never received them. I had asked for this before at least twice from the bank and have never received them. My loan officer told me to request an extension that I would get that no problem but I also was denied an extension for no reason. I told him I was denied for an extension he was shocked and baffled when I told him this. I received a copy of my credit report it show that I was behind on my second mortgage payment and that I owed a XXXX XXXX bill of {$250.00} I called the company they told me they did not receive payment and I authorized them to take money from my account which they did and marked the account paid in full. I also seen the pnc heloc loan had late payment of {$23000.00} for the full amount and the account was closed. which they never notified me that the account was closed and the full amount was coming due and needed to be paid in full. The heloc loan had an XX/XX/XXXX due date not a XXXX due date. The bank never sent me any paperwork or documents extending my due date or when it would be due in full. I always got the run around. Considering I have more that {$120000.00} of equity in my home I would never default or let the bank take the property. I would prefer to refinance or sell the house and pay the bank the money owed and not risk my retirement savings. But I never received any documentation or proper legal notice of my due date. A 30 day notice is not enough time to do anything. When I got my heloc loan I signed papers and I knew way in advance that the loan would become due in XX/XX/XXXX. If I would have gotten proper and reasonable due date of at least 1 year or 6 months advance notice and not had the fraudulent inaccurate reporting to the credit agency this could have all been probably fixed and avoided. today I continue to make all my payments and I am not behind on any payments as agreed upon by the terms of the loan and that for this reason I am not in default triggering a foreclosure or the loan being called due. Now I called the bank and they told me to speak to there bankruptcy department. That does not make any sense. I have also been waiting for my legal heloc loan documents that I signed and have requested 3 times. I am requesting these documents again saying the loan is due and must be paid in full XX/XX/XXXX. 
I feel sick and discriminated against by this bank in the way they have treated me unfairly and unjustly. I have health issues and have been able to make all my payments till the present time. The only hardship I have was created gross negligence and fraudulent deceptive practice of pnc bank.

I have called and addressed this issue likely 100 times in the last 2 years.

OCWEN 's lawyers conspired with my lawyer to commit fraud and did. OCWEN paid my lawyer XXXX XXXX and I paid my lawyer to refinance the property I live in, after discovering that there were 14 violations of TILA and RESPA in my purchase and sale. They conspired to settle the debt by adding 10 's of thousands of dollars in fee 's. Because of it I am now unable based on the settlement able to correct them on the fact that they wrote into the settlement that I could never sue again for any reason including if they broke the law again. No lawyer can intercede because the CAL BAR will not allow them to negotiate with mortgage companies any longer. No lawyer will sue any other lawyer for such a small amount - no one is interested. I have escalated this to the CAL BAR  and they are investigating - this should take more than a year based on another case similar to mine that I am privy to. 

There is a reason that OCWEN is the most often sued lender on earth."

Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

My personal information on my credit report is inaccurate as well. I have requested to have my addresses, phone numbers and names corrected on my report this is a violation of my consumer protection rights."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I rarely use my credit to apply for things. I thought I would test the waters when I thought my reports looked okay. I decided to buy a new futon in XXXX, XXXX. I thought I would try to get a credit line increase with my Citibank MasterCard. I called expecting to talk to a human. I never spoke to a human. The voice activated computer took the calls for credit line increases and said they could make the decision without making hard pull inquiries on my credit report. I gave the info requested. A moment later the recording denied the request. I was very upset. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I thought I would look into buying a futon I saw online from Wayfair using a lay away plan or explore some other option like that. Again, I rarely use my credit and didn't know what sort of options there were. I called Wayfair and told the phone clerk this. She surprised me. Without telling me where she was transferring the call, someone from Citibank answered the phone. I thought "" Oh no! "" The man who took the call had a bad attitude : he didn't know/he didn't care. I told him what I was trying to accomplish to buy a new futon from Wayfair : Lay Away or some other plan. Would he please explain my options? He didn't explain much just that I had to give my information before he could tell me what my options were - AND HE LIED. 
He put me on hold and came back moments later and said my request had been denied. I said for what? He said for the line of credit. I told him I thought he was going to tell me what my choices were before doing anything at all. He said this would be a Hard Pull Inquiry on my credit report. I was really upset. I asked why my application was denied. He said there was a consumer statement that said there was a security freeze on my report and not to grant credit unless first calling me at my number, and he said he had been trying to call me but no one answered the phone. This was a total lie. I was waiting on hold for him to come back online and was using the phone with the phone number XXXX XXXX XXXX I have been using since the year XXXX. No one tried to call me while he had me on hold. 

I was very upset. I called everyone I could think of at Citibank that day to complain and ask them to avoid putting the hard pull inquiry from that botched up conversation on my Credit Report. I spoke to a lady in Citibank banking department who was very familiar with Letters of Deletion to remove wrongfully placed XXXX Pull Inquiries from people 's credit reports. While she had me on hold, she filled out the form and the letter and said she would forward them to another department who would finalize things, and thought the inquiry would be removed pretty soon A few days later I checked my report. Unfortunately, there it was! : the Hard Pull XXXX from Citibank on my XXXX report dated XX/XX/XXXX. The Hard Pull XXXX said Citibank- not Wayfair. I filed a Complaint for XXXX with the XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a phone call from XXXX from Citibank in South Dakota on XX/XX/XXXX. She said she was forwarding the file to XXXX, and told me to expect a call from XXXX soon. XXXX to XXXX days later XXXX called XXXX explained the Citibank Hard Pull Inquiry on XX/XX/XXXX was from the Wayfair credit application, and did not have anything to do with the credit line increase request on Citibank XXXX in XXXX, XXXX - as was discussed in my first complaint filed with XXXX. I told XXXX what happened with the man who answered the phone for Citibank who had a bad attitude, and was supposed to explain what he had to offer before pulling my credit. 
His reasoning for turning down my credit application was based on a sloppy attitude ; and this was unfair to me for him to put that Hard Pull Inquiry on my Credit Bureau XXXX because there were no calls waiting for me to answer while I was waiting on the phone for him. XXXX said she had to look into things, and said she would call again. 

When she called, XXXX said that the story the man gave was false- and explained that the XXXX middle numbers he wrote down from my Social Security XXXX we're wrong and he pulled someone else 's credit file. She told me she would look into things, and call again. 

She called the next day and decided not to honor mentioning fraud having been committed by this man at Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX for having recorded the XXXX middle numbers of my Social Security XXXX incorrectly. She decided to be "" old school '' and hard nosed - even though during XXXX of our phone calls I told her I had just been through a nightmare when I bought my car and trying to have all incorrect hard pull inquiries removed from my credit reports ; and how I didn't have to go to the car dealers for them to submit Letters of Deletion ; and that all ll I had to do was talk to live agents at the credit bureaus - and they removed the hard pull inquiries while I was on the phone with them ; and that this was all done with all three Credit Bureaus in XXXX afternoon I also told XXXX what the lady at Citibank said on XX/XX/XXXX after the awful experience with that man at Citibank. The lady said, "" Dont be fooled, because all banks and creditors know about Letters of Deletion, and have them on hand ; and, Letters of Deletion are easy to complete and submit. '' In spite of this, and in spite of XXXX confessing to the fraudulent situation that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX middle numbers of numbers of my Social Security XXXX recorded incorrectly by that man and his decision to deny me credit for the futon ) XXXX decided to be a jerk and not remove the Hard Pull Inquiry Citibank placed on my XXXX Credit Report due to this man 's sloppy work- and XXXX is an example of an old school XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX : Investigation by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took more than 30 days from my opening of a direct dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Investigation by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took more than 30 days from XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX Credit bureaus did not update reports during these periods stating that the information was being disputed with XXXX perhaps XXXX  violated FCRA by failing to contact the credit bureaus to inform them of these disputes. Credit reports were not provided to me during these periods. 
I was not notified timely of investigation status or results. 
I was not provided with any names of people contacted and other elements, etc. connected to these investigations per the FCRA 's definition and requirements of an investigation. 
Their investigation did not fix the many inaccuracies that I pointed out to them on my report, which they have inaccurately reported for years. Please see the emails from two XXXX executives and their remarks acknowledging the inaccuracies ; the timeframe ( longer than 30 days - months even ) that has passed and yet no removals have been made per FCRA. 
I've had difficulty submitting disputes or getting information about a dispute over the phone with credit bureaus. 

I realized during the summer of the pandemic that my XXXX credit card account had some serious inaccuracies and reporting issues. I then realized the reason for my credit denials and high interest rates for any credit that I could obtain since XXXX and high insurance premiums. For almost two years, I have disputed inaccuracies across the XXXX bureaus and directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for my credit card account ending in XXXX. There have been instances where they suppressed my credit report so that I could not see the years in question whenever I pulled the reports, therefore I could not resubmit a dispute because there was no item listed to dispute. There are many violations per FCRA on this account due to it not being reported 100 % accurately. It has been happening for years and they willfully refuse to do anything about it. The bureaus have stated that they report the data that XXXX supplies to them. There have been times where there were different balances reporting at the XXXX bureaus and I had to dispute those to have them all updated. There have been different account statuses over the years where one would say "" pays as agreed '' and another would say "" Late over 30 days at least 6 times '' or "" Current, was 90 days past due '' during the same reporting period. The date account opened and date account closed do not match on the 3 bureau reports either. Each time I have disputed the account with the bureaus and with XXXX directly, they send back the same response, that the account is reporting accurately. If the account is reporting 100 % accurately, why are all of the account statuses, date opened, date closed, amount of days late, amount of times late, etc. reported differently with all XXXX bureaus? I have submitted copies of my credit reports from the XXXX bureaus and a table showing the inaccuracies to the bureaus and XXXX and they still say that this is 100 % accurate and have willfully chosen to keep the information the same. My credit and opportunity for any new credit has been ruined due to this one account. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a subprime auto loan due to these inaccuracies and the reporting of this account. I have had to pay astronomical interest for this car loan due to the inaccuracies and the way in which this account is reporting. I am certain that my car insurance rates were even higher due to this as well. 

XXXX has instructed the customer service representatives via notes in the system that they are to refer me to the executive team for this matter and they can no longer work on this case or give me updates as it is out of their hands on the lower level. Customer service reps have told me all that they see in the system is a note that says the items will be deleted, but there is nothing they can do because it is an escalated item. The thing is, none of the executives are available by phone ; they are avoidant, delay the process, dishonest, not engaging and not interested in resolving this matter. I have emailed the CEO of XXXX and he promised me that they would submit an Automated XXXX XXXX to the credit bureaus in XX/XX/XXXX to resolve the matter. It is XX/XX/XXXX and nothing has changed except the bureaus have made unauthorized alterations and modifications. I have been rerouted to another XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and he is always out of the office, on another call, on vacation, or awaiting someone else in the department to give him an opinion when he is the decision maker. He told me over the phone that he could bring remedy to this when there were damages that were discovered. He clearly sees them via the credit reports and charts that I compiled and sent to him via email and the CEO does as well, but they refuse to resolve it and compensate me for the violations. Over the years, I have been denied credit by XXXX and other creditors because of this account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX and Equifax because XXXX bank told me that they could not increase an existing tradeline for me because there was a note on the XXXX account stating that I was late. I was not late and had not been, and could not see that note on my personal consumer reports. Subsequently, XXXX Bank closed down the account which was in perfect standing with excellent payment history. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX denied me for a personal loan due to this account which is housed with them. However, they are always emailing and mailing me advertisements as if the opportunities are open to me. 

After several disputes and calls, and being told by XXXX and the 3 bureaus that the account was 100 % accurate I filed another dispute directly with XXXX via email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. ( attachment ) I told them that they could not do a hard or soft pull on my credit to check the data, as they should have an accurate record and archive of what they have reported to the bureaus on file. 

Despite me sending an outline of the inaccuracies and violations attached to the email, on XX/XX/XXXX ( 45 days later ) I received a response letter via postal mail that said the account was accurate and they will continue to report it as-is. I'd compiled a chart to make it easier for them to see where the inaccuracies lie, hoping this would make the process go better and faster. If they were reporting 100 % accurately as they continue to state, why do each of the bureaus have different information and why does none of the information match for the months/years, statuses, and dates in question? ( response letter attachment ) Also, XXXX did not notify the bureaus that I was disputing the information that they continued to report during this time. I received no correspondence from the bureaus regarding the matter, and no copies of my credit report during this period. No notices were included, stating that I was disputing this information. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the CEO of XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I explained the situation to him since no one else in the institution would budge and any supervisor who was in the credit department was always unavailable according to customer service. His response was boilerplate as well ; stating that they must report accurate information by law. That was my point exactly ; they were not following the law with all of those inaccuracies. He told me that they could not honor my request at the time and that they'd done a soft pull on my credit and saw no inconsistencies in reporting. I specifically wrote them via email in XX/XX/XXXX, and told them that they did not have my permission to do a hard or soft inquiry on my credit report, yet he claims that they did it anyway -- against my written instructions telling them not to. 

I filed another dispute with the bureaus and I received responses from them at the end of XX/XX/XXXX, stating the same ; the creditor says the information is accurate. ( credit reports attached ) I noticed that Equifax made modifications to the payment history after I disputed this time, yet they did not remove it from the file ; they reduced the amount of time on each occurrence as if they were doing me a favor, which is again, still inaccurate data! You will see on my chart and previous credit reports before the XX/XX/XXXX dispute results, that Equifax was reporting a certain amount of days prior to the XX/XX/XXXX dispute, and on the XX/XX/XXXX dispute results they modified the time under the "" Account History with Status Codes '' section that show XXXX and XXXX data. The number of days that fall within the status codes do not match the number of days they were reporting in previous reports. Still, none of the data matches what the other bureaus have for this account for those same months/years. I was confused as to why they did this. 


I called XXXX to follow up and continue to fight for my rights on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX. The Case # was XXXX. I was given the extension to the credit dispute department which I was told was XXXX at the time. 

XXXX XXXX emailed me back on XX/XX/XXXX and stated that on XX/XX/XXXX, the automated universal dataform was submitted to the bureaus. XXXX submitted an automated universal dataform to all XXXX bureaus to fix the matter. ( email thread attachment ) On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX. and after 47 minutes, the representative came back on the line and told me that they were awaiting a confirmation letter from the credit bureaus that the XXXX and XXXX items had been deleted from my report and that I'd receive a letter after that. This was 3 months after the CEO of XXXX told me in XXXX that it would only take 30 days for the process. When I contacted the bureaus, they said that they had not received anything from XXXX except normal data like my payment updates whenever I made monthly payments, and if they had received anything additional, they would have updated the account accordingly. 

XXXX reps have given me various case numbers over time after time including : XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 

I received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that the new case that was opened by a XXXX representative was closed due to the issue already being completed, however I had no clue as to what issue had been completed! Nothing had been completed or resolved. I'd received no written correspondence or update from XXXX although the XXXX promised in XXXX that I would within 30 days from the date they'd submitted the AUD to the bureaus. 

After receiving the letter stating the issue had been resolved, on XX/XX/XXXX, I pulled my credit reports and XXXX was reporting 8 late payments, had changed all of the "" number of days late '' data and reduced all instances to 30 days, changed the status to "" Current, was past due 30 days six times or more '' and the status date was still XX/XX/XXXX, but the payment date for that month was reported as XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX deleted 4 of the inaccuracies and kept 4, and the status read as "" Paid, or pays as agreed '' yet the number of days for the instances that they continued to report did not match XXXX 's data reporting or status. I am not certain what process they used to choose which 4 to delete and which 4 to keep. The year XXXX was suppressed on XXXX 's XX/XX/XXXX report and I could not view this data. The same thing for Equifax, 4 instances were deleted and 4 were kept and they were not the same month or amount of days that XXXX was reporting chose ; none of the account information matched. The year XXXX was also suppressed in this report. Both statuses read the same, "" pays account as agreed '' and the status updated date was XX/XX/XXXX. After I expressed that I felt I was being discriminated against, Equifax and/or XXXX even removed the excellent payment history that I had on a XXXX Installment account that was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. When I called them and questioned why they'd removed my payment history from the XXXX installment account, they told me that XXXX could do it if they wanted to. To sum it up, XXXX and the XXXX bureaus did not notify me about these changes. I received no correspondences by mail, no copies of my credit reports, no communication whatsoever. I only knew because I monitor my reports on a consistent basis. The letter that I received on XX/XX/XXXX and these data changes prompted me to call XXXX the next day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX and spoke with a representative regarding the letter that I'd received, which stated that the "" issue '' had been resolved. I thought that they'd finally resolved the matter like they promised, but to my suprise my credit reports remained the same after this - not reporting 100 % accurate and with so many inaccuracies, violations, and modifications on this XXXX account. They told me I had to continue waiting and it was an XXXX issue now. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX 's dispute department and they claimed that they would remove the late payment reporting due to the inaccuracies reporting on the account across the bureaus for XXXX and XXXX, and instead they deleted my entire account - erasing all of the excellent payment history, eliminating an account as well which decreased my credit score and history. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX at or around XXXX XXXX, inquiring as to why they deleted the entire account as opposed to the inaccuracies only and they stated that I must submit a letter of verification that the XXXX account belongs to me and that it is accurate! They clearly never asked my permission to report it from the beginning, but now since I've asked them to right their wrong-doing, and challenged their modifications, lack of investigation and refusal to take my evidence as proof of the FCRA violations XXXX they punished me by deleting an account that I've worked so hard to maintain rather than just fix the inaccuracies. 

Here 's where XXXX 's major problem XXXX be. In XXXX, I recall XXXX offered me a "" re-aging '' program. They told me that they would re-age the account and that re-aging would not hurt my credit. I have done that, but they did not tell the truth. I have paid this closed {$17000.00} tradeline account down to {$2200.00} in less than 4 years and they have done nothing but ruin my credit and my life since then, and the bureaus have helped them to keep this up by reporting the inaccuracies. They closed the tradeline, did not report the account 100 % accurately, denied me credit and other creditors denied me credit due to this account, and the notes and various statuses that they added to the account over the years. It has been over 6 months since the CEO of XXXX promised me that the AUD would go out to the bureaus to make this account 100 % accurate and that has not happened as the email thread will and credit reports will show. 

They have had well over a year to resolve the issue. Attached, you will see credit reports and a chart that show the side by side 3-bureau comparison of original data reporting and violations. You will also see email correspondences between XXXX departments/executives and me, and you will see current reports that show that they have not resolved this matter and the inaccuracies and FCRA violations are still there. When I have complained numerous times to XXXX and Equifax and opened disputes over the phone, I did not receive a credit report by mail or in any other form. Whenever I called to check the status, I was told that there was no dispute on file. They were using this method to start the 30-day process over again and delay time. I also noticed all of my disputes that have been filed online are missing from the online archives portal in my account. They suppressed my reports and I can only view 2 or 3 years which all show excellent payment history, but a creditor can view every year reported beyond those years and I can not ; nor can I dispute that information if it is not listed. I had to view the reports on XXXX which sometimes I'd get a message saying I could not view the reports at this time. I was finally able to submit a dispute and get a response in XX/XX/XXXX which I spoke of previously. 

Equifax now reports a status that says that I have XXXX late payments on myequifax.com, but when I scroll back through the years, all of the inaccuracies from XXXX are still there. When I pulled my current XX/XX/XXXX Equifax report from myannualcreditreport.com, I can see all of the inaccuracies are still reporting and do not match the other bureaus. Previously, they'd deleted 4 payments and kept 4 on the report. Now all 8 are showing again and still do not match the information reported by the other bureaus during this reporting period. Additionally, my XXXX installment account which had excellent payment history was wiped clean of all payment history. They deleted all of my payments and the installment account was never late, was paid off early in XXXX and had nothing to do with this situation. If they must report information accurately, how can they tamper with a positive account with excellent history that was paid and closed 5 years ago and has nothing to do with the situation ; yet refuse to fix the account that is being disputed and has inaccuracies? That is another violation of my rights and FCRA. I want to be compensated for those violations as well, for every payment that is missing from the XXXX installment account, which is dated from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX. This was done intentionally after I mentioned discrimination over the phone. XXXX and XXXX are still reporting the payments, however some of them are missing as well when they were not before. 

XXXX remains the same, reporting inaccurate information. XXXX deleted the entire account based upon the credit reports and chart that I submitted for the second time, affecting my credit score because I lost an XXXX XXXX XXXX account and its history which affected my scoring calculations. All of the bureaus and XXXX have willfully violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act for years, have violated my rights, caused financial loss and detriment. I am still dealing with the effects of it to this day with a subprime auto loan and high insurance premium ; let 's not forget the numerous times I was denied credit opportunities when I, my family and business needed it."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"-- - USDOE/XXXX - This account is being reported with an abbreviated name, the full name of the servicer should be on the account. 

XXXX  and Experian are reporting the Date of Last Payment as XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  is reporting it as XX/XX/XXXX. No payments are due to this account at this time, however these dates are all inconsistent. However, XXXX  is reporting the Date Last Active as XX/XX/XXXX, Experian shows XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX   shows XX/XX/XXXX - none of these dates match and how can there be activity when no payment has been made? 

All three bureaus are reporting the high credit as {$57000.00}, but the balance shows {$62000.00} for XXXX  and XXXX  while Experian shows an amount of {$62000.00}. This is a violation that has failed to be addressed repeatedly. - These amounts do not match. This information is not being reported 100 percent accurately according to the law. XXXX  has repeatedly failed to report this account was in dispute at all. XXXX  removed that this account is in dispute from the comment. 


-- -- XXXX XXXX - XXXX  is the only company reporting this account on top of there being an invalid account number. I am also only listed as an authorized user. This is not considered my account and should be removed. 


-- -- Another XXXX XXXX  account is being reporting by Experian and I am only listed as an authorized user, this isn't considered my account. 



-- -- - XXXX - XXXX  is reporting the high credit limit as {$2300.00} while the credit limit was left at {$0.00} while XXXX  and Experian are reporting the high credit amount as {$2800.00} with a credit limit of {$2300.00}. 

XXXX is reporting the Date Last Active as XX/XX/XXXX while Experian is reporting XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX  as XX/XX/XXXX. These dates are supposed to match since they are supposed to receive the same exact information from the company. The date of last payment for Transunion shows XX/XX/XXXX, but the date last active is XX/XX/XXXX. 

Experian also shows a date last active as XX/XX/XXXX, but the date of last payment as XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  shows as date last active as XX/XX/XXXX with a date of last payment as XX/XX/XXXX. Why do none of these dates with these companies match? This is not being reported accurately still. 

I have also been making payments to this account since XX/XX/XXXX. I have paid XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX so far. The two year payment history doesn't even reflect this. None of the bureaus are reporting this information. How can they have verified this account and still be reporting all of this so wrong? 




-- - XXXX  XXXX - I have been making payments ever since XX/XX/XXXX to this company up until now. Experian shows a two-year payment history with CO, however XXXX shows I have been making payments since XX/XX/XXXX. Experian is reporting this wrong. 

Experian shows a date last active as XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  as XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX  as XX/XX/XXXX. Again I have been making payments to this account since XX/XX/XXXX. However, XXXX  is reporting the date of last payment as XX/XX/XXXX, Experian as XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX  as XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX   shows a last reported date as XX/XX/XXXX, Experian shows XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX  shows XX/XX/XXXX. This information is not only inaccurate, but being reported inconsistently by all three bureaus.

This Company took over the said load and demand me to pay over {$1200.00} they said it was for the demand of the flood insurance I never was required to maintain before. Nothing Changed. I demanded an legal Opinion from their Attorney 's to no avail over a year asking for the same request. They always send a break down of Forced Charges. This same company is involved with several other Banks and Mortgage and loan companies.. for taking kick back from Insurance companies to include the one they are forcing me to obtain insurance with on their behalf. My name is also included in this suit/ The mortgage company knows this and I feel they are refusing to follow their own rules with my previous Mortgage Company XXXX. Again the XXXX previous under the same contract never required or forced me to obtain Federal Flood insurance. Documents have been sent asking them to prove I needed extra Flood Insurance. XXXX and XXXX XXXX has indicated my property location is not or has no Flood Base Line documents or will not have until the State of Florida until l late 2017 They were advise of same. I feel we are being Discriminated against us because of the Current Law Suit among other things. We are XXXX XXXX and asked about Mortgage re financing to no avail we ever received and assistance. When I told the female on the phone she said she did not know how they could add the forced applied insurance to the back of the loan because they would always have to re calculate the figures. Seriously I said The computer always does that. She said She would have to check, so after a few days I call back and she said she had no clue what I was talking about but did remember my name. Closing I asked them to keep my mortgage showing in the credit history as the {$420.00} and not the XXXX because it raise my monthly causing issues when I have tried to get some loans. Normally only the Mortgage is showing because the insurance they are forcing me to purchase they made me have the Insurance company bill them so I had to call the Insurance company. They did obtain Flood Insurance from a company because no one would give me Flood Insurance at the government rates. So even thou they did help me get Flood Insurance against my will, Should have been billed separate as the regular insurance to keep my Credit History, No of the Insurance report the or my Credit status to any of the Credit Bureaus to the best of my knowledge. Also I ask to no avail why are they adding all these extra fees like Property Inspections {$30.00} when My Property Has never been inspected by any company. They have several thing they are charging us, like something called XXXX. On their invoice they have a area showing Optional Insurance they could show on their invoice for these forced insurance that I have several times tell them I disagree but paying under protest so they cant take our home for us. This all has caused a great deal of XXXX causing me to continue to have medical issues because this wrong, illegal, I have never been late to the best of my knowledge and asked why to they keep saying they are the collection agency. I do have copies of what I faxed them, They said the best way to contact them is to fax them and after I fax them the send me notice that I have a new Contact person, Go Figure No we are scared they may continue to Harassment us because of my complaint. I feel that they are doing all this in spite because of the Current Law Suit Closing even though they got me flood insurance that I asked to no avail to prove and yet to do so. I send them copies of both the State and XXXX stating our property has no basic Flood Zone for our property. Thanks so what say U"

All but two months of this time I was under the aforementioned forbearance. Because of this information on my report, it directly resulted in the denial of my apartment application. 

I disputed this information with XXXX, the service that conducted the credit check for the apartment I was applying to, explaining the information as I explained above. Loancare claimed the reporting was accurate. 

I contacted Loancare to inquire about this. The agent I spoke to at Loancare was able to confirm I exited the forbearance at the time in which I've stated I did. I also have signed and notarized correspondence between myself and Loancare confirming the new agreement and the date it went into effect. The agent told me to file a dispute directly with Loancare providing all of the information, sent from them, that I had. I did so. After one month, Loancare mailed me a letter upon finishing their investigation and claimed that the reporting was accurate. 

I called Loancare back to get to the bottom of this situation. After eventually speaking with someone in a supervisory position, it was explained to me that because my account was technically delinquent right before I entered into my forbearance, which the reason for was directly related to the XXXX Emergency, all reporting after that time was reported as delinquent, or in this case, 30 days past due. I explained to the representative that the way my credit report, based on Loancare 's reporting, reads to any potential future lender, is that I neglected to make payments on my mortgage for well over a year, when in fact it isn't that black and white. I asked if they could contact the credit agency, XXXX, and request my report be fixed to reflect a non-delinquency status during the time I was enrolled in my forbearance with them, which was XXXX of XXXX through XXXX of XXXX. I didn't ask for the delinquency for the month prior to my forbearance be removed, just during the time I was told I wouldn't have negative reporting on my account. The Loancare representative told me that although they were the ones reporting the delinquencies, there was nothing that they could do. She told me I could dispute it with XXXX to have it corrected. 

I called XXXX and filed a dispute with them on XX/XX/XXXX after explaining all of the aforementioned information. XXXX finally finished conducting the dispute today, XX/XX/XXXX and Loancare maintains the information reported is accurate. My report reads the same as it did before the dispute with the exception of my report reading that the overall account is closed and paid."

Consumer Loan,Vehicle lease,Managing the loan or lease,Unknown,"I have had a vehicle lease with Ally Financial since XX/XX/XXXX. I have been manipulated more times that I like to admit with this company and the paper trail I have is Astronomical. The start of the problem occurred back in XX/XX/XXXX of last year when I had fraudulent charges on my account that caused a check payment made on my behalf to be reversed. I however, was not made aware of this stop payment nor does it show record on my Banking account or with proof provided by Ally. But that did n't stop Ally from charging me a Late fee for over a year. I will include a Payment summary that I had Ally fax me as you can see that even on this sheet the accounting is off, and there is no proof or significance of a late fee accruing or charged. Part of my biggest compliant here is that I have NEVER received paper billing nor did I opt out of such, so I have been forced to used a mobile app to make monthly payments, and even that does not show late fees or notices. I have not gotten a call until this month ( XX/XX/XXXX ) letting me know that I have over {$220.00} worth of late fees to be exact, and they tried to smooth things over by telling me that they wo n't accrue interest and they can be paid anytime. I 'm sorry but I 'm still getting a {$30.00} late fee per month until they are caught up, and come to find out they have been dinging my CREDIT as well! I 'm outraged at how violated I feel in all of this, and at the hands of a company with XXXX customer service. I have made a phone log of how many times I have called their office only to be transferred at a minimum of XXXX times, and then when told my fees would be waived by speaking to someone in esculation and I was of course then disconnected! My most recent phone call was a total of XXXX hours and XXXX minutes. The only time I was able to get somewhere with a representative is when I finally got someone who spoke no broken XXXX and she also agreed that she showed no calls or reason why I would n't be receiving paper statements and that I also based on her billing summary I was paid up to date with a credit of {$11.00} on loan payments, regardless of late fees. She also promised that I would receive a call back within XXXX hours in regards to the paper statement issue and I still have yet to hear from them and that was on XX/XX/XXXX I feel like I am getting no where very fast with this issue and I need help in resolving this matter. I am very aware that I am not the first and I 'm sure I wont be the last they take advantage of. I would sooner have another bank take over this loan, but the damage they have done to my XXXX in just a year has n't helped me, and I feel very stuck! Therefore, If I ca n't get this resolved at this level I will seek Legal Council regarding possible UDAAP violations at consumerfinance.gov."
Debt collection,Medical,Disclosure verification of debt,Not given enough info to verify debt,"ARS Account Resolution Services has ignored my written letters now on 2 separate occasions. They keep sending me a letter stating they have confirmed the outstanding balance of {$1400.00} but have failed to provide the proper physical documentation to validate the debt. XXXX can not provide the original source document according to a phone call with them today. Also even though ARS may not be guilty of breaking federal law HIPAA the medical facility is because I do not have an recollection of signing a waiver stating they could share any of my personal information with anyone other than me. Unless they have this on file the information that they turned over to you is in violation of HIPAA. There are bylaws in place in both the FDCRA and the FCRA that states that if you are going to try to collect on a debt you must have on file the original source document showing my signature. Without it this service or debt can not be validated. Electronic Communication simply saying you have confirmed the debt is not compliant within the law. At this point since I have tried by writing twice now, I am going to ask that you immediately send me the physical documents showing my signature validating that this debt is mine or cease with all collection activity immediately. You are to also send notification to all 3 bureaus removing any collection accounts from all 3 bureaus. If this is not done I will be forced to file compliants with all state and local agencies that you answer to as well as filing a compliant with the State Attorney Generals office asking for a full investigation into your collection practices.

I previously sent a letter addressed to the Credit Bureaus requesting that the Credit Bureaus take their time to verify the information being reported on my XXXX XXXX. I am victim of Identity theft and the accounts I am disputing were the results of such crime. I Started disputing my Credit File on XX/XX/XXXX under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act section 605b and the last letter I sent to the Credit Bureaus was dated XX/XX/XXXX. The Credit Bureaus have failed to remove the disputed accounts completely from my Credit report and insisted that the information they report are accurate and verified. I do not agree with their findings and demanded proofs of verification for me to be able to verify the information myself. But the Credit Bureaus have also failed to send me copies of documents to support their claims. I am now submitting this CFPB complaint to order the Credit Bureaus to remove the disputed accounts completely from my Credit Report as soon as possible for they have failed to comply with my requests. I need the following accounts deleted immediately : XXXX XXXX & XXXX ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX Balance : {$3300.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$0.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$0.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$0.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$0.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : {$900.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Opened : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with fraud alerts or security freezes,Unknown,"Experian makes is very difficult to place/remove a credit freeze on your account - unlike other reporting agencies where you can simply login with a user name and password to enable/disable your freeze -- Experience requires you to fill out a lengthy form, with a pin and address history, social security number etc. Which if you fail just one attempt, you are then not given another attempt, you are instructed to mail your request in, which is ridiculous if you need your account frozen ASAP. If you DO happen to answer everything correctly, and move on to the next step, then you are instructed to answer a questionnaire based on questions in your credit file, which again, if you get one or  two wrong, you fail and are instructed to mail in your request. If all else fails and you have to mail in your request, then the authentication process is EXTREMELY difficult, because it becomes a back and forth of snail-mail letters which accomplish nothing.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit repair services,Fraud or scam,Unknown,"Below is overall summary of the event which I have sent in an email to the executives of M & T bank as well as the board members : To Whom It May Concern : This communication is a desperate final measure to resolve a time sensitive issue. M & T Bank has reported three late payments on my credit history in error, which is subsequently impacting my pending mortgage approval to buy my first home with my XXXX  fianc. 
In XX/XX/2018 I moved from XXXX XXXX Pennsylvania to XXXX. Upon moving, I submitted my change of address to M & T Bank in person at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX. In XX/XX/2018 I lost my credit card, reported it missing the next day, and requested that a replacement be mailed to me on the recorded customer service line. After two weeks passed without receiving my card, I called again and was advised that a charge of {$25.00} would appear on my card for the expediting a second replacement, but would return as a credit since the error was made on M & Ts behalf. The {$25.00} charge was placed on my card, never reimbursed, and I never received the card. After 3 days passed, I called the M & T customer service line to inquire about its whereabouts and was told that it had been delivered. I was informed yet again that I would be charged a {$25.00} expedition fee, but would be reimbursed for M & Ts mistake. The card never arrived at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX PA XXXX. After 3 more business days passed, I called a fourth time and finally discovered that my change of address was entered into the system incorrectly by an employee at the aforementioned XXXX XXXX XXXX as XXXX XXXX XXXX which does not exist, causing my card to default back to my previous address, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX. 
I was instructed to go into a branch in person to correct this error, receive a refund for the multiple expedition fees, and to finally obtain my replacement credit card which I had been without for over a month at this point. When I did so, the branch manager would not help me and I was directed back to the customer service line. 
Ultimately, my decade long tenure as a client with M & T Bank came to an end as every employee I spoke to both over the phone and in person refused to help me. I switched banks and gave up the fight over the {$50.00} not knowing that M & T Bank had submitted 3 separate past due claims for my remaining balance of {$8.00} during the time this went unresolved despite being owed more than my remaining balance by M & T. 
Now, as I am attempting to purchase my first home, I am discovering that M & Ts error is reducing my credit score by roughly 50 points and negatively impacting my mortgage rate. It is my hope that you are able to bring this to a quick resolution rather than have this drag on for months, as it would prevent further unnecessary use of time and resources for all parties. My next steps will involve the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Correspondence from Nation Star was initial confusing and dismissed as solicitation ; however, after notices from XXXX XXXX XXXX that my payment needed to be redirected to Nation Star, I was able to reset my Bill Pay with my bank to the address noted on the Nation Star correspondence. Unfortunately that information was inaccurate and after a few calls to Nation Star I the issue was resolved ; however, I made XXXX month 's payments beyond the transfer of my mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I confirmed each time that they were sending it through to Nation Star ; however, Nation Star could not confirm this for both months and informed me I was late on my payments. They required me to confirm the debit from my account by faxing backing statements ; however, I do not have access to a fax and they would not provide an email address to send the confirmation electronically. After multiple calls to my back, XXXX XXXX XXXX and Nation Star I was able to pressure/complain enough that I was then provided an email address to send documents for research. To complicate the issue and transition, I had set my Bill Pay up with XXXX different address ( both provided in the Nation Star correspondence ) and sent XXXX payments in XXXX for my XXXX payment. I recognized the error with XXXX of sending the funds and was able to get my back to request a return of funds to Nation Star ; however, Nation Star was unresponsive indicating the excess payment was applied to my delinquent amount. After significant time and pressure I was able to get the Nation Star customer service agent to conference call my bank to confirm the debit from my account and to facilitate the requested return. Also via the conference call I was able to get confirmation of my prior XXXX payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX thus "" documenting '' my payments. Nation Star indicated that since this was not documented they would begin to research the issue and track the missing funds through XXXX XXXX XXXX, despite my verbal reference to the payment and dates of payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX and my confirmation of receipt and forward of funds by XXXX XXXX XXXX via bulk payments to Nation Star. While I contributed to the current issue not transferring my payments on time to the new mortgage holder and by sending XXXX payments in error, resolving the issue through Nation Star remains exceedingly difficult and they have yet to confirm payments received from XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a financial institution I find their ability to track and respond to issue underwhelming. I was even told by more than XXXX agent that Nation Star is not a "" large banking agent like XXXX XXXX XXXX '' as an excuse why the information could not be researched promptly. I will be shopping for a new mortgage, despite the expense of closing costs etc., to get my mortgage out of Nation Star 's hands ; however, I am concerned that my mortgage can simply be bought again by an agency with poor service and inaccurate financial processing."

My Loan Number is XXXX First Problem : On XX/XX/XXXX they conducted a Escrow Analysis and there was a surplus of {$1400.00}. That amount was deducted from my escrow account on XX/XX/2021. The escrow analysis statement indicating the that there was a surplus is dated XX/XX/2021. I was told by two representatives that the check was mailed out same day. I don't believe that to be true as it is unlikely they would mail a check the same day as the escrow analysis. Today is XX/XX/2021 and as of yet I have not received the surplus check. Tomorrow is 29 days since the account was analyzed and the surplus amount was deducted from account. Included is the monthly statement.

Problem Number 2 : As of yet this account is not being reported to the credit bureaus. We are 70 days into this. I see this is an ongoing issue with Shellpoint.

Problem number 3 : Shellpoint seems to be slow at things that benefit the consumer aleast they are very fast at things that benefit them. Within 30 days of being transferred I received a letter stating they did not have the HOA required insurance for the common area and they would be force placing the insurance the HOA is required to have. This would mean I am buying insurance for my neighbors house as well as the common area. I have since submitted the required documentation and we are all squared away but how is this practice legal especially in California?"

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"Ocwen Mortgage company took over my mortgage approximately XXXX to the best of my memory, and I did not know who they were or anything about them. I had no choice in this matter and did not seek another mortgage company, they picked my mortgage to exploit for profit. As it turns out I discovered they are merely a collections agency that got into the mortgage business during the XXXX housing crises. They are a nonlending mortgage company that finds people that have had mortgage payment problems and then exploit this by raising the mortgage payments without explanation or remorse to force the sale or foreclosure of the house. They have raised my mortgage payments on a 30 year fixed rate loan ignoring requests for an explanation for the increases in my payments. I was forced to hire a lawyer in XXXX trying to deal with this company and forced into bankruptcy only because of them and trying to not lose everything I have worked for my entire life. 
In approx XXXX XXXX they had raised my mortgage by over {$800.00} from the original payment amount and there was no way I could pay it I sought help from them still not knowing they were merely predators seeking profit. I was instructed by their representative XXXX XXXX to get 3 house payments behind allowing them to do a mortgage reconstruction dropping my interest rate and house payment. This was a tactic that when I was behind 3 payments I would not be able to refinance with another mortgage company and would literally be locked into a mortgage reconstruction with them. I did as i was told got 3 payments behind and began the mortgage reconstruction making my 3 trial payments of {$1100.00}. They sent me te paperwork to sign and my principle had gone from {$210000.00} to {$220000.00}. When I inquired and asked for a written explanation for this {$13000.00} they refused and would not explain it and told me to just sign and send the contract. I refused without seeing a written explanation. I tried to make the fourth payment and Ocwen refused my payment and within 5 days sent me foreclosure papers. It has been a legal battle ever since then costing me money without seeing any relief. 
Ocwen is well known to CFPB as they were shut down from obtaining new mortgages for the doing to others as they have done to me. Unfortunately, they see the CFPB as a toothless tiger and have merged with another company PHH Mortgage and continue to operate using the same tactics as always. I am now doing battle with PHH Mortgage and my lawyer that admits I was forced into bankruptcy only because of Ocwen has done nothing for me yet has had me send money to the mortgage company that has done nothing to help my situation. In effect it has ruined me, a XXXX veteran that is a XXXX  and I am going to be forced out of my house with nothing. Ocwen/PHH Mortgage are destroying the lives of people every day and disregard every government agency that slaps them on the wrist."

Regardless of how many times I claim to be the individual writing this letter it seems this message is truly missed. For the record, Im the one whos initiating these disputes under MYNAME. The following items are UNKNOWN to ME. I dont get why youre claiming these are fraudulent or of a high risk nature. The documents Ive provided are legit. These are mine, filed with the appropriate agencies & support my position. Lets get the record straight!!! First of all I know that under FCA Section 619 Obtaining information under false pretenses that any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined under title 18 United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. Most importantly, Ive never sent my documentation to anyone else which seems to be claim that constitutes high-risk due to potential fraud. According to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) Determination That Dispute Is Frivolous or irrelevant ( A ) a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information. ( B ) Notice of determination. Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph ( A ) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. Again, under 617 Civil liability for negligent noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681o ] a person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( 2 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

Debt collection,Federal student loan debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"To Whom It May Concern : In XX/XX/XXXX, I graduated from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Over the course of those 4 years I took out 15 loans that totaled {$83000.00} across at least three different loan servicers. It was very difficult to keep track of all those loans so shortly after I graduated I consolidated them all and dutifully began repayment. 

Never once late on a single payment, and scraping together whatever extra I could to lower my principal balance, by XXXXthirteen years after graduatingI had reduced my total student loan debt down to {$13000.00}. After being emancipated at the age of XXXX and putting myself through college shortly thereafter, this felt like an incredible win. 

However that feeling quickly dissipated on XX/XX/XXXX after answering a call from a woman named XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. She told me I had a XXXXXXXX XXXX in default with XXXX. You can imagine how surprised I was to receive a call from a collections agency after how faithfully I had paid back my student loans, and that more than a decade had passed since I would have taken out said loan and this was the first I was hearing about it. Another thing that really surprised me was that I had closed on my first house just a few days before taking her call, a process that took over a year to complete as it was a short sale, and my lender ran my credit report no less than 3 times throughout the year, never once finding any loans in default. 

I explained to XXXX XXXX that I had consolidated all of my student loans after I graduated. I remember her saying that she hears this happen often with XXXXXXXX XXXX, that for some reason they dont get included in the consolidation. 

But why was this the first time I was hearing about this loan? XXXX XXXX told me that XXXX had a phone number I didnt even recognize on file. I asked if they had my XXXX email address on file as it was a main means of communication with the school while I was in undergrad, and I still actively use it to this day, plus I am actively on the XXXX alumni network e-mail list. She said they did not have my email address on file which totally shocked me. How earnestly were they trying to get a hold of me about this loan? I get calls every year from XXXX asking me to donate money, surely my phone number is on file somewhere at the school! And it clearly wasnt difficult for XXXX XXXX to find my correct phone number considering she was just issued my case and able to immediately find it. Whats more, I answered the phone on her first attempt, showing that I was not in the practice of dodging calls. 

Where the true misdeed comes in is that the loan was now more than double its original amount. When I first took out the loan it was {$3500.00}, but now after all the collection agency and other fees were tacked on, I was told the balance had drastically increased to {$7600.00}. ( As you will read below, the balance was in fact even higher than that by more than {$700.00}! ) My heart sunk. Just when I thought I was in my final stretch of paying off my student loans and therefore able to afford my first housea dream Ive worked towards my entire lifeanother XXXX XXXX of debt is mysteriously thrown into my lap. It felt extremely predatory. Had I known about this loan when I initially consolidated after graduation, I would have paid it off, and on time. Just as I did with every other loan I ever had. 

The second transgression occurred when I was told that there was only one option for settling up on the balance. I asked XXXX XXXX if I could pay off the loan in full in order to negotiate a lower balance. Ive heard plenty of stories of others blatantly ignoring their student loans for years, then once the collection agency contacts them they are able to knock off thousands of dollars in exchange for repayment. Surely there was something that could be done to lower my balance considering that the original loan amount was less than half the current balance, and I had absolutely not defaulted on purpose. I suggested I call XXXX directly to speak with them about this possibility, but XXXX XXXX told me that XXXX had passed my case on to her agency so negotiating wasnt possible and my only option was to consolidate this XXXXXXXX XXXX, at its current balance with all its fees and interest, with my one remaining student loan that I held with XXXX, and that it had to be on an Income Driven Repayment plan, and that she would walk me through the process right there on the phone. So she talked me through every step I needed to take on the studentaid.gov website to consolidate the defaulted XXXX XXXX with my XXXX loan during that first call on XX/XX/XXXX. Once we finished all the necessary steps, she told me that the consolidation shouldnt take more than a week or two to fully process. 

A couple weeks passed and the XXXX loan still wasnt showing in my XXXX account which worried me as I thought new late fees could be accruing with each day, so I decided to call the XXXX XXXX XXXX directly on XX/XX/XXXX to try and get to the bottom of everything ( despite XXXX XXXX telling me it would be useless ). I left a voicemail explaining my situation and asked for a call back. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a very helpful woman named XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). She told me that my balance was in fact {$8300.00}, not the {$7600.00} amount XXXX XXXX had told me over the phone. I later also received a physical letter from the collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX with the {$8300.00} balance. 

I couldnt believe another {$600.00} was somehow added to the balance! XXXX XXXX said she could at least remove a late fee of {$100.00} from my balance ( though that doesnt seem to be reflected in my current balance ), and told me about a rehab option for my XXXX XXXX which XXXX XXXX XXXX neglected to mention. 

Although the initial payments for the rehab offer were significantly higher, it had the benefit of removing any past due reporting from my credit report once I had completed 10 months of on-time payments, which I wanted to take advantage of. However I first needed to figure out where things were in the consolidation process so that I could cancel it and instead elect for the rehab offer. 

After speaking with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX that same afternoon at the collections agency to ask why the XXXX loan amount was suddenly higher than the amount she originally told me it was, and if I could cancel the loan consolidation so that I could move forward with the rehab option I had just learned about. XXXX XXXX told me that there are often discrepancies with her system and the schools system which is why the numbers were off. She then started a conference call for the two of us with XXXX who was processing the consolidation to check on its status as it had already been more than three weeks since I submitted the consolidation request. The XXXX rep told us that the consolidation should be completed by the next day so it was too late to cancel it. I really wasnt surprised that just fell in line perfectly with the whole saga. 

In summary, here are the unscrupulous and predatory issues I would like to address : First and foremost, it does not seem that XXXX made an XXXX effort to contact me about this loan before it went to default. 

When the consolidation went through my student loan balance increased from {$13000.00} to {$22000.00}. This reflects a {$8300.00} increase which is higher than both amounts I was previously quoted by both the collection agency and the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Of that {$8300.00} increase, {$4800.00} is fees. This might not seem like a lot to some, but it is to me. Thats {$4800.00} that I need to fill my oil and propane tanks, replace the dangerously frayed electrical service wires on my house, repair my stove, pay for my health care, etc. There is no shortage of immediate bills and this is a lot of money to divert from them for fabricated fees on a loan I didnt even know I had. 

The {$100.00} late fee XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX said she removed from my balance was never actually removed, or at least it seems that way I never received an itemized breakdown of the XXXXXXXX XXXX balance so I have no way of knowing. 

I was not given all my options for repayment during that initial call with the credit agency, specifically the rehab option, and was led to believe my only option was to consolidate right then and there over the phone. It wasnt until I took it upon myself to call XXXX XXXX XXXX directly, which the collections agency rep strongly discouraged me from doing, that I found out about the rehab option. But at that point it was already too far along in the consolidation process to switch to the rehab option. 

I would appreciate a reduction on my loan balance considering the exceptionally predatory practices I was subjected to. Thank you for your time and consideration."

I had a credit score of over 750, income of over {$65000.00}, no current debt, good work history, and over 20 % down payment in cash. The branch manager failed to educate and purposely provided selective information about FHA and Conventional loan. He explained the Conventional loan as "" no good '' and referred to it as the "" XXXX '' loan who only benefits "" white people ''. The FHA loan was explained as the "" Obama '' loan and the only loan that I would be able to qualify for. He intentionally and purposely informed me of information to force me to obtain a FHA loan. False information was provided to me. For example, I was informed by him that the only way to eliminate a PMI was to provide a 20 % down payment which is incorrect. After gathering further information, I created a chart flow that presented the amount of money I would be required to pay over the life of the loan for both the FHA and Conventional loan. It clearly demonstrated that thousands of dollars would be saved with a Conventional loan. This goes to show that obtaining the FHA loan is beneficial to RMS than it is to the borrower. All information gathered as well as the chart flow was brought to the branch manager 's attention where he admitted that it is accurate and that he failed to provide us with this information which resulted in us choosing the FHA instead of Conventional loan. He stated he was "" sorry '' but being that it is the day before closing we had to proceed with the FHA loan. Prior to this meeting the day before closing, I tried numerous times to contact the office by email and phone but was ignored. The office purposely ignored us to by time and to prevent us from switching to the Conventional loan. The branch manager also forced us to use a particular lawyer and even credited us money towards closing to use her. The day of closing the lawyer forced us to sign all paperwork all while only one owner was listed on the title. The branch manager knew to include both names to the title and ensured us it would be done yet only one name listed at time of closing. The lawyer stated that lenders do not recomend quick claim deeds but that is how she will add the second name to title. The branch manager was contacted numerous times by all parties at the time of closing and failed to respond. He responded 4 days after closing.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"I owned a first mortgage with Chase and a HELOC also with Chase. I was contacted by Chase to offer opportunity to re-finance. I met with mortgage person. The mortgage process was complicated and required a lot of work on my part. As example, their mobile app feature MYHOME does not work properly and I was unable to upload documents to the app as requested, so to satisfy this request, I had to log onto a computer for the first time in 10 years to bank via Chase.com which required me to get security pass codes sent to establish identity. Next I was told I would not have to verify income because they could verify it via my direct deposits via Chase checking, then was later told I needed to produce them for pay stubs as well as multiple years of W2s even though I was a 24 year customer. I did all of that. When my closing was scheduled for a Saturday. 1 hour before the closing XXXX called to cancel it and stated that "" Chase did not reply to multiple requests to them in order to have the closing on time. They said Chase did not verify my include among other things. Then, it was rescheduled for XXXX the following Wednesday and the night before the called to confirm it was scheduled for XXXX. Then I changed my schedule to accommodate that new time. Then, the morning of my rescheduled closing I got a call confirming it was for XXXX and I said no it was at XXXX. They called XXXX and then I got a call back saying it was not happening at XXXX  because they assigned my closing to another notary. I had to engage to make the closing happen at XXXX  with the second notary but then was concerned that the first notary had all of my personal documents. The closing did happen that day at XXXX. I signed all of the documents and 4-5 days latter received the cash out portion to use to pay down debt. One of the closing documents said that my property taxes were paid current and through XX/XX/2022. Turns out even though that was in my closing package, somehow between Chase and XXXX they both missed that my property taxes were not paid. Currently I have {$5800.00} property taxes due. Chase had not made a good faith effort to resolve this issue and has passed the escalation around to a team internally who said they will follow up with me by XXXX XXXX. Since this issues is time sensitive with property taxes due I want to escalate this to the highest level. My complaint is : poor service, broken tech/tools in MY Home Mobile, missed closings, multiple rescheduled closings, major error in reconciling and balancing the closing of the mortgage which resulted in property taxes not being paid timely, financial impact to me given I thought property taxes were paid and now they are due. Chase offers a {$2500.00} closing guarantee if a closing is missed due to no fault of the customer. But the fine print says NOT for Re-finance. I believe this practice is unfair because regular mortgage customers get prioritized over re-finance customers and these service failures result."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Unknown,"On or about : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I contacted NFCU mortgage and explained that my husband was staying in XXXX due to his job, and because of the recent fiascos with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX program, he was in default of his student loans after paying the required 10 years, under the Trump Administration and therefore I would be applying for the loan under my name only. 

I further explained because we have separate jobs in separate locations, we are still married and will continue to be married and XXXX would be occupying the XXXX XXXX XXXX house, while I occupy the XXXX XXXX property. 

Your loan agents said it would not be a problem. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was approved for the loan at 2.5 % with 0 points/fees and it went to underwriting, where it sat and was ignored for months. 

I contacted the assigned representative, XXXX XXXX, no less than three ( 3 ) times inquiring about status, none of my emails or calls were returned. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX calls me to say that the previous loan processor, XXXX XXXX, forgot about the loan and was terminated and she would be taking over the loan processing -- 6 months past the time the loan was supposed to be approved. 

XXXX XXXX then requests previously load documents, and states, that she sees they were loaded but can not find them. I reloaded all of the documents, the trust, etc to the file in less than 24 hours. 


During this time XXXX has had a remote assignment given to him, so we rented the XXXX house out for 30-days and provided all the documentation to demonstrate that he would be returning to the house as an owner-occupied property, including the fact his job is located within 15 miles of the XXXX house at California XXXX in XXXX, CA. 

Still, the loan was rejected stating owner occupancy. I had explained the situation in detail when I first applied for the loan and it was deemed acceptable and now that rates have risen and 2.5 % is a great deal NFCU is using this occupancy as an excuse for their negligence. 

NFCU RE resolution representative got involved and made statements such as : "" Unfortunately, the information provided to us again yesterday was that the current tenants are not vacating the property any time soon and we have no documentation reflecting the contrary. We also do not have any verifiable documentation that illustrates your husband currently resides at the property or will in the near future '' When in fact she could not have know this since my Property Manager for the address was never contacted. 

Then the NFCU representative ( XXXX ) replied with : "" Thank you for allowing me to review your application further, so that I my provide you with information regarding your loan decision. Occupancy status requirements are based on a borrower 's intended use for the property. Unfortunately, your husband 's occupancy. now or in the future. would not be taken into consideration as he is not a named borrower on the loan application. You have provided information that the XXXX XXXX XXXX property is your primary residence, therefore we can not refinance XXXX XXXX XXXX as another primary residence. '' To which I replied with : XXXX, You seem to be changing the target again which indicates that NFCU is fully negligent with this loan and therefore I will be seeking damages, I fully disclosed the facts during the intake with NFCU, I repeated these facts with XXXX XXXX and yet NFCU took my loan with full disclosure that XXXX had this the main residence, and our married taxes are filed from that house it undermines your arguments. 

Therefore I would like to request ALL the voice recordings as a pre-discovery."

XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX : # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : # XXXX Dept of XXXX XXXX : # XXXX XXXX XXXX : # XXXX I am writing to bring to your attention the improper and inaccurate information that is listed on my credit report with Experian XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Despite numerous attempts to have these errors corrected, the credit bureaus continue to violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

I want to bring to your attention that I have been a victim of identity theft and have no recollection of the accounts listed on my credit report. I have provided my identity theft report that is attached to this report as proof. The fact that these accounts are being reported as mine is causing me great distress, and I am very concerned about the impact it may have on my creditworthiness. As a victim of identity theft, I am entitled to certain rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

According to 15 USC 1681c-1 , if a consumer has contacted a credit reporting agency and informed them that they are a victim of identity theft and provided the agency with proper proof, the credit reporting agency must block the information that the consumer identifies as resulting from the identity theft within 4 business days of receiving the identity theft report. The agency must also notify any person who has received the information that it has been blocked and must provide the name and address of the furnisher of the information.

Furthermore, according to 15 USC 1681g ( d ), if a credit reporting agency knows or learns that a consumer 's credit report contains information resulting from identity theft, it must either block the information or delete the information from the consumer 's file. The agency must also notify any person who has received the information that it has been blocked and must provide the name and address of the furnisher of the information.

I hope that you will take my situation seriously and investigate the inaccurate information on my credit report thoroughly. I am confident that once you review the evidence and see that I am a victim of identity theft, you will take the necessary steps to ensure that my credit report accurately reflects my creditworthiness. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

- The presence of these inaccurate accounts on my credit report has caused significant harm to my credit score and has negatively impacted my ability to obtain credit or financing. Inaccurate information on a credit report is a violation of my rights as a consumer and is something that should be taken very seriously.

- Additionally, I have made repeated attempts to contact the credit bureaus and request that they remove these accounts from my credit report. Despite providing verifiable proof of my identity and the fraudulent nature of these accounts, the credit bureaus have failed to take action and have continued to list them on my credit report.

- I have also contacted the companies associated with these accounts and informed them of the fraudulent activity. They have confirmed that I am not responsible for any of the charges listed and have closed the accounts. However, the information remains on my credit report, which is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

- According to the FCRA, credit reporting agencies are required to conduct a reasonable investigation of any disputed information and to promptly delete inaccurate information. This is especially true in cases of identity theft, where the consumer is not responsible for the fraudulent activity and should not be penalized for it. 

- As a victim of identity theft, I have taken all necessary steps to report the crime and to protect myself from further harm. However, the inaccurate information on my credit report continues to be a source of frustration and financial harm. It is imperative that the credit bureaus take immediate action to correct these errors and to ensure that my credit report is accurate and up-to-date. 

According to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), the credit bureaus have a legal obligation to modify or delete accounts that are not reporting accurately. However, the following accounts continue to be listed inaccurately on my credit report : In accordance with XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have the federally protected consumer right to privacy and confidentiality. However, the credit bureaus have continued to list inaccurate and improperly reported information on my credit report. 

Furthermore, according to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if they know or have reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. Despite my notifying the credit bureaus that specific information is inaccurate, they have failed to take the appropriate action to correct it. 

I have requested that the credit bureaus check and ensure that all information on my credit report is complete and accurate in accordance with XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, I have not received any response from them within the XXXX timeframe. 

Additionally, the credit bureaus have failed to record the current status of the disputed information, which is a violation of FCRA. 

Overall, I urge the CFPB to take swift action in this matter and to ensure that the credit reporting agencies are held accountable for their actions. The Fair Credit Reporting Act was put in place to protect consumers from inaccurate credit reporting, and it is crucial that these protections are enforced. 

I am an FHA program buyer and Experian 's inaccurate reporting is holding me back from purchasing a house for my family. I urge you to take immediate action and hold the credit bureaus accountable for their failure to follow FCRA and correct the inaccurate information on my credit report. I have documents attached detailing VERY SPECIFICALLY proof of the inaccuracies down below this report, along with verifiable proof of my SSN, driver 's license, and credit card statement. I urge the CFPB to take swift action in holding the credit bureaus accountable for their violations of the FCRA. 

IMPORTANT : ALL ATTACHEDbDOCUMENTS ARE 100 % WRITTEN AND MARKED BY ME AND ONLY ME. Please have EXPERIAN, XXXX, & XXXX only respond via CERTIFIED MAIL in a HAND WRITTEN RESPONSE stating the name of the person replying back to this matter. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I responded and said below {$100000.00}. he came back and said what if I could do {$1000.00}, I said no. Then he said about $ XXXXI said no. then he said {$990.00}? I again said no thank you. He proceeded to tell me about the loan process and refinancing option that I had. I kindly told him that I was looking around at other mortgage companies because Freedom Mortgage screwed me over about a year or so. I told him what happened and he said that he can assure it would not happen to me this time around. I told him I was weary based on the information he was providing me around the escrow analysis process. ( This is how I got XXXX  last time ) He offered to send me the documents to review the numbers and terms of the loan, I said great. Mind you throughout our conversation he kept saying "" I don't think you understand what I am saying, let me re-explain '' he said this about three or four times throughout our conversation. He was not listening to my questions nor what I was saying because he had tunnel vision of a possible close on a refi. I had to tell him three times to get off the phone to send me the documentation and I would be in touch. He kept going! What part of I am not interested at this time don't you understand. I finally hung up. I got an email that says, please review and sign your loan documents. WHAT?! I didn't agree to anything first of all. I can not view the documents unless I start signing them. Then I got a follow up email that says "" URGENT- reminder to e-sign your loan documents '' I AGAIN can not view anything without signing documents. I am so disgusted with this company at this point and how aggressive this person was then lied to get the loan documents in my email and con me into signing something I said multiple times that I didn't want to do. I can not wait till rates come back down, because I am done with them. I will not be treated this way nor be conned into something I said I didn't want to do.

This agency send a compromised offer, but they did not expose the truth of my arrangement with The XXXX apartment complex. I hereby attach a copy of an email between myself and XXXX, Assistant Property Manager at the apartment complex in question. My move out from this complex was requested professionally as I was facing a family crisis back in XXXX State, and the ownership was understanding and agreed that I would only be responsible for the days whereas my apartment was nor re-rented, but that the management would advertise the apartment for rent immediately. The email response I have posted on this complaint shows that XXXX apologized that he was sorry the apartment was not advertised, and that he would not charge me for this mistake. This response concludes any argument that I owe anything towards the Fair Collections & Outsourcing , Inc . In addition, the settlement offer by FCO is hereby void, mainly because there is no lease termination fee in the entire lease, as posted for your review. This entire collection is a violation against my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the leasing by-laws of the state of XXXX, and since FCO posted the collection on every credit bureau, a serious violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. FCO has acted devious by adding charges to an invoice that are not included in my lease, and the fact remains that my move was amicable and the management of XXXX agreed that I was not going to be charged for the apartment post move. FCO must file a removal of the case and send removal letters to all pertinent credit reporting agencies on behalf of XXXX and XXXX respectively."
Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"On XX/XX/2019, my mortgage was assumed by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. On XX/XX/2019, I made my mortgage payment online. At that time I attempted to apply an additional amount to my principle balance, over and above my minimum payment, but the website did not allow me to. I subsequently emailed this company to inquire why this happened. I received a response that said I wasn't able to pay additional principle because there was an outstanding {$99.00} fee due on my account. When I called to inquire what this fee was for, I was told that this was for a `` drive by inspection '' that they performed on XX/XX/XXXX. I never asked for, authorized, or was advised of this appraisal. 

My complaint is twofold. First, how can this company arbitrarily charge me fees for appraisals that they, at their own discretion, deem necessary? Two, how is it legal for them to limit my ability to pay additional principle amounts when I make my payment? 

Thank you for your attention to this. I look forward to your response."

( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer 's right to privacy.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was provided the contact information of XXXX XXXX at Amerifirst Financial Inc to assist me with the purchase of a home in XXXX XXXX Nevada. The information was provided to me by my Buyer 's agent, XXXX XXXX from XXXX and XXXX who highly recommended XXXX and advised me she would definitely be able to provide me with a loan. I proceeded to make an offer on a home on XXXX XXXX and proceeded with an XX/XX/XXXX loan application. XXXX assisted me with my loan requirements and provided me with a pre-approval letter with the intent of closing on XX/XX/XXXX. I put a deposit in escrow of {$25000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX to advise me that the investor who offered XX/XX/XXXX loans pulled out of the XXXX XXXX market and is no longer offering these types of loans and we would have to source another investor and extend closing. My loan contingency was extended through XX/XX/XXXX and subsequently to XX/XX/XXXX with closing extended through XX/XX/XXXX. Despite being qualified for the loan and meeting all requirements and providing all the documents being requested, Amerifirst was not closing my loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I receive a call from XXXX and my broker advising me that their systems were hacked and they can not access my files and will need to extend the closing further to XX/XX/XXXX while they work out how to submit all the documents manually. i'm asked to resubmit all the documents to XXXX to her personal email so she can forward them to the underwriters. At this point my loan contingency had lapsed due to delays from Amerifirst that continued without any clear communication as to what had transpired and why. I was assured my loan was approved and that it was a matter of time to close. Despite multiple requests from me and from my agent to get an update on the status of my loan, my lender did not return calls or emails including an email that I sent to the CEO of the company and a voicemail that I left for him explaining my predicament and asking for urgent assistance, no one got back to either myself or my agent. Every day until XXXX, I was assured by my lender that my loan was approved and that the XXXX 's were going out that week. On XX/XX/XXXX, when I was due to close escrow, I was informed by XXXX that they needed another extension as the underwriters were still reviewing the file, but I was assured my loan was approved and that I would be closing by XX/XX/XXXX. I kept asking about my deposit and I was assured I would not lose my deposit as I will be closing on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from my agent who asked me to send an email and call XXXX asking her to transfer my entire mortgage file to another lender so that I didn't run the risk of losing the house as Amerifirst had failed to produce my loan approval and failed to send my closing disclosures. The other lender was the seller 's agent lender and the seller had agreed that if I transferred the file over to the new lender, they will extend my closing by 2 weeks to allow time to close on the house. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and explained that I needed her to transfer my entire file which she confirmed she would despite being upset for losing her commission, and I sent her an email the same day requesting the same copying my agent and the new lender. She called me back and confirmed she would send my file but she failed to send my file to the new lender, and instead issued a loan approval letter and an email on XX/XX/XXXX saying that my XXXX 's had gone out. This letter and email went to the seller 's agent, myself, and my agent. At this point, her email served as a confirmation of a loan and my agent told me there was no need to move forward with another application to the new lender. I had already started the application on XX/XX/XXXX, but didn't proceed upon instructions from my broker. On XX/XX/XXXX, the seller put the house back on the market. I immediately contacted my agent XXXX and my lender XXXX to let them know and pleaded for help. XXXX did not respond, but XXXX called to tell me that she will contact the seller 's agent as the XXXX 's were on their way and I should have no issue closing on XX/XX/XXXX. She then asked me to provide a few letters of explanation for minor items/amounts in my bank account. I provided all that she asked for on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I chased XXXX and XXXX and XXXX was not responding. XXXX kept telling me that the XXXX 's would be going out that day. For 2 more weeks, I kept chasing the lender and my agent only to be told they were "" working on it ''. In the meatime, the seller proceeded with marketing the house and selling the home. Despite meeting every request made of me by the lender and despite giving me a firm loan approval letter, the lender failed and fraudulently tried to impede me from going to another lender to save her commission on the transaction at the expense of me losing my home purchase, losing my deposit of {$25000.00}, incurring extensive additional costs for temporary housing, moving expenses, hotel stays, and losing my ability to purchase any other home due to the hiking market prices. I am filing a complaint against XXXX XXXX, her manager XXXX, the CEO of Amerifirst, XXXX XXXX, for giving me false information, failing to protect my earnest money deposit, and for failing to close my loan despite providing a loan approval and confirming that XXXX 's had gone out. This was pure misrepresentation and deceptive practices."
Debt collection,Payday loan debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I took out a payday loan with Solo Funds in 2020 for {$120.00}. For some reason my repayment did not go through on the due date. Solo funds reached out to me via email and I responded advising the could repay my account using my debit card on file, and we agreed to a certain date. Maybe there was something lost in translation but the repayment either didnt go through or was never attempted. I randomly got a phone call from a XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that I owed Solofunds over {$1900.00} and that I needed to set up an arrangement to avoid being sued. I was confused as I knew my loan amount was for only {$120.00}. I set up an arrangement with them and reached out to Solofunds to clarify. When I spoke with Solofunds they stated that I could settle with them for {$140.00} and to disregard collection efforts. I paid this account a few days later and solofunds confirm that payment was received. I canceled my card with XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Today I received a call from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. The representative was very aggressive and told me I should not in any way have paid Solofunds because they now owned the debt. I asked for verification of the debt and they sent me a letter with no bill of sale or anything. I immediately said that I would be seeking legal counsel and she ended the phone call by saying I will send this over to the court. I think they are fraudulently collecting debts."

Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",Unknown,"This letter is a request to have the derogatory credit reporting related to this account removed. I have gone through numerous layers of bureaucracy and in-house complaint procedures to get this issue addressed without making any progress. 

This loan was originally XXXX of those infamous neg-am loans that reset in the middle of the big credit crisis back in late XXXX early XXXX. We had taken the neg-am option planning to use the time period of the introductory rate to remodel the house. The plan was to refinance into long term financing once the remodel was complete. However, by the time we were ready to refinance it was impossible to get any credit at all. 

We attempted to get a loan modification from Chase but, unbeknownst to us, were put into a situation which later came to be known as "" dual tracking. '' The state of California passed a law banning this in, as I recall, early 2010. Chase and several of the other big XXXX banks paid huge fines. Unfortunately, none of the benefits of the new legislation nor any of the money from the big fines paid did anything to help my situation. 

The "" dual tracking '' worked like this : On the side visible to us, we had a "" single point of contact '' who took our loan mod application, discussed with us our options and told us what we had to do to get the loan modification. Basically, this person crunched the numbers with us, told us we were approved and that we needed to wait until the underwriters were finished with drafting the new agreement before making any payments. We were told that we could not make any payments during that interim or it would cause the loan mod to re-set and that the underwriters would have to start all over again. 

Despite numerous calls to my "" single point of contact '' this story did not change. In fact, the longer it went on, the more that person stressed that making a payment would derail the process. 

Then, we were contact by the foreclosure department and told that we had 60 days to pay all of the outstanding payments plus an ungodly amount of late fees and penalties, or they would foreclose on the house. 

Between the "" single point of contact '' in the loan mod department telling us that we would be getting our new paperwork "" any day now '' and the foreclosure department giving us a hard deadline leading up to foreclosure, we decided to sell the house. Although we sold for much less than the property had appraised for, we did not have to ask for a short sale. 

Now, six years later, we are looking to refinance some loans which originated prior to the financial crisis. Being able to refinance these loans would result in savings of thousands of dollars a month. The negative reporting on the Chase mortgage loan is XXXX of the major obstacles preventing me from completing the proposed refinances. Plus, this reporting is updated every time I request an investigation from the credit bureaus causing this account to appear as if it were new. I 'm told that this single derogatory account is lowering my score by @ XXXX points alone. 

What I am asking Chase to do is report on the mortgage history as if reflecting the loan modification side and not the foreclosure side. You see, I was following the directions given to me by that "" single point of contact '' which were that I must not make a payment. I agreed with those instructions and followed those instructions. 

My non-payment during that underwriting period not only reflected the agreement between myself and the loan modification department, I was told that there would be a penalty for making a payment, i.e. total reset of the agreed upon loan modification. 

Please update the credit reporting to show that the account was "" paid as agreed. ''"
Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,Unknown,"My wife and I worked on a refinance out of an OCWEN loan in to a new loan from loan Depot since XX/XX/2016. As the process neared completion XX/XX/XXXX, OCWEN has now refused to endorse the loan to a new lender and will not provide allonges in order to complete the process. Quoted response from Ocwen here : "" I 've been advised by our legal counsel, that it is legally valid to prove ownership, and I have been instructed not to provide any allonges in case such as this one. I understand the lenders concerns, as I have heard this from a number of other lenders, however this is our position, and it is not negotiable.

We have a documented conversation with Wells Fargo Supervisor XXXX XXXX as well as her employee ID # XXXX. When we received a call that our HELOC was late, we were escalated to XXXX XXXX ( supervisor ) who explained to us that Wells Fargo had NOT Processed the payment, through no fault of ours and that no late fees or late notice would be filed - It was purely a Wells Fargo bank error. 

Second misreported late : We have Conformation # XXXX for payment on XX/XX/XXXX Letter of receipt from Wells Fargo saying they received payment with correct full routing number and correct last four of our account number. 
And a Note from my husband speaking with representative, same story, the told my husband that Wells Fargo just did not process. We were contacted by Wells Fargo saying they would look into it. 

Wells Fargo told me they listened to recording and have no proof that we did not give them a wrong number? With all of our payments we depend on Conformation numbers to say we have made our payment, then to get a letter to say the same. Only to have the bank weasel out of taking off this MIS-Reporting because they reported the date THEY PROCESSED, which is after they noticed THEIR mistake.

I saw that this collection was removed last year this is actually the 3rd time this company has reinsterted a collection that was removed. 
They reinsert is by changing balance, original creditor and account numbers. 

I called XXXX XX/XX/XXXX regarding this matter. 
The agent claimed that they do not reinsert debts. 

I can clearly prove to you that they have indeed reinserted this not only once but this is the third time. attached you will see former credit reports. that show this account. 

Which they already know that this was my dads, and he had passed away. 
XXXX and their other Company XXXX is very well aware of this situation. 

I have submitted everything in the past I have also other certified letters from the original creditor the hospital that say that they have no record of XXXX XXXX that is writing this. 

I submitted a dispute with experian I also have a membership. 
I tried to dispute using my log in. It tells me to call. 
Somehow when I call Experian I am somehow rerouted in every way and hung up on. 

Please tell me is this intentional? Why do you all keep changing the account numbers balances and original creditor? If it was not intentiontional please remove. I understand you all are a business but I am a real person that actually has a dad that past away with the same name. 
Also this company you claim is original creditor has a website http : XXXX which is very strange because in my last complaint they had another website https : XXXX you will see the hospitals in attached. 

I believe this company is fraudulently pretending to be hospitals in order to allow consumers and credit reporting agencies to believe that they are authentic and valid original creditors. This is Fraud. 
I'm pretty sure XXXX does not know this but I am now totifying you. 

Wherever you are buying up this data is selling fraudulent information, Please see the attached.

I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as Free Annual Credit Report, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either Experian, XXXX XXXX or XXXX  respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. I believe that since the CFPB is the sole responsible oversight party of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its imperative that any additional solicitation of information from the credit bureaus should be blocked permanently. I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request. The credit reporting agencies are an important aspect of the national banking system to properly function, but the current aggressive marketing campaign soliciting citizens for an arbitrary FICO score has gone too far, including but not limited to Experian XXXX. We must return to a common ground that is fair for all consumers in the United States, and we must be able to request additional marketing on our own terms. Accordingly, I am making a request for a free credit report with confirmation number to my attached email address. Thank you.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I currently have an auto loan with JP Morgan Chase and I have automatic payments setup with them. I received a notice from the bank that my auto loan is delinquent for the XXXX and XX/XX/2018 installments. I called the bank on XX/XX/2018 and advised that I have automatic payments setup and that my account should not be in default. The representative then explained to me that the bank experienced system issues with automatic payment system which resulted in my XXXX and XXXX payments to not be drafted. I then paid the amounts due by authorizing a phone payment in the amount of {$780.00}. I did not think much of the credit reporting impacts as they advised that they had payment system issues. I thought that since they made the error, that it would not impact my credit. 

My husband and I recently applied to refinance our home. While going through the refinance process, it was brought to my attention that my auto loan reflected a 30 day delinquency in my credit report. I further investigated the matter by pulling my credit report with the 3 credit agencies. XXXX and XXXX did not report any delinquency but showed a lapse in payment for XX/XX/2018. XXXX   reported my XX/XX/2018 payment as 30 days late. I am attaching copies of my credit report, payment transaction history from my checking account and a screen shot of my chase online banking settings confirming that I have automatic payments setup. 

I do not believe that Chase has treated me nor other customers affected by their payment system issue fairly. I also believe that this is an FCRA violation. The bank made an error which resulted in non-payment and reported my account 30 days late. The bank should have done the right thing and ensured that they were proactive and corrected any negative credit reporting that stemmed from their payment system issue. My credit report should not be penalized due to this bank error."

I talked to multiple people and was given different instruction. I was told that I will have my payment deferred for a few months while everything gets settled. That never happened and they kept reporting me late. I understand these were tough times and that bank employees were having a hard time navigating through this.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... .."
Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"In XXXX 2015, I looked into securing an apartment for my daughter who had just XXXX from University XXXX XXXX, TX and had accepted employment with a XXXX company. We toured the "" District at XXXX '' and decided that my daughter would like to live in this apartment complex. I then proceeded to write XXXX checks ( {$200.00} and {$170.00} ) to complete the application/administration and background check process. 
Several days later the district informed my daughter that the checks I wrote were returned as NSF checks. I immediately contacted my credit union and they confirmed that there were sufficient funds in my account to cover these amounts and that there was no shortage of funds in my account that would have triggered this issue. 

I then called the leasing office and tried to explain this matter to the agent. Since the leasing agent could not comprehend this issue I asked to speak to the business/accounting office. An employee in the business office spoke to me briefly and was extremely uncooperative towards me even after I offered to send a copy of my bank statement that would have clearly shown that there were adequate funds in the account. 
In the next 2 weeks I tried to contact the business office only to be told that they would not take my calls. The issue became compounded since I live in XXXX and could not drive down to the Apartment complex ( in XXXX ) without advance planning and inconvenience to my schedule. Since my daughter had to report to her new job on XXXX XXXX, we had to search elsewhere to secure a place for her to live. 
On XXXX XXXX, a debt collector ( from National Credit Systems ) named XXXX XXXX called my daughter and threatened and intimidated her, demanding that she pay {$470.00} immediately. My daughter was extremely traumatized by XXXX XXXX 's telephone call. I later called the collection company only to be bullied by XXXX XXXX repeatedly. I then called the "" District at XXXX '' but they again refused to speak to me. I then sent them an email asking for an explanation. 
I received a reply from the manager - XXXX XXXX with an attachment that shows that they attempted to collect on the XXXX checks I had written, but the way in which they presented it to my credit union was incorrect. In fact the account number was correct but the account holder 's name they used was my daughter 's name and not mine. I immediately emailed the manager and pointed out the error. She then replied and stated in her email that she would waive some of the charges but I would have to pay {$170.00} in the form of a money order and once they received these funds they would contact the collection agency and instruct them to stop harassing my daughter. In order for my daughter to have peace of mind we decided to pay the {$170.00} immediately. 

I have the email trail with file attachments from the "" District '' that clearly shows that they made an error but they continue to try to extract money from unsuspecting customers. 

I can be reached at XXXX XXXX XXXX if needed."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"On XX/XX/2017, we purchased a home from a new home builder, Dreamfinder, in XXXX, TX. The builder, Dreamfinder, had a preferred lender they associated themselves with, and part of their promotion was that the lender, PrimeLending, would pay the first 3 months worth of Taxes, HOA, and Home Insurance. We shopped around with different lenders and found a lender that offered a less expensive interest rate at that time. We had a lender that was quoting us half a point less than the Builder 's Preferred Lender. The company, PrimeLending, said that because they were associated with the Home Builder as the Preferred Lender, they would be able to beat that deal and offer me the promotion of first 3 months of Taxes, HOA, and Home Insurance paid for me as part of the closing costs. When the Tax Bill came out at the end of XX/XX/2017, the Tax amount due was substantially higher than when what was pro-rated when we closed on the home.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX XX/XX/2019 Ms . XXXX & Office of Consumer Affairs Office of Consumer Affairs Equifax XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX Dear XXXX from office of OCA & Equifax I am writing to explain a host of mal-practices I have endured since my return from military duty from XXXX. To begin, there are several situations that have made feel that I am being treated unfairly. However, there is this one moment that still lingers in my head. Upon my return to the States, I was informed that my credit file wasnt locked due to a computer glitch/breach. Dismayed, I wondered how is it possible for an entire entity with the stature of Equifax, neglected to successfully place a military hold on my account. The situation bothered me since I was sure that I had not done anything wrong. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have called and asked to be transferred to the supervisor of OCA. Literally, I called each day and have phone records attached to verify the hours spent on phone calls to Equifax. I have spoken with several helpful agents in the OCA ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) and have spoken to agents who have subjectively blown me over as though my concerns had no adherence. These agents ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) have either mocked my military service or denied me access to receive a call back from Ms. XXXX. Foremost, I thought XXXX  being XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX  while in XXXX was bad, and things could not get any worse, it did. 

The main reason I thought I was facing this treatment was due to my military XXXX background. They were fond of using and then sayings you shouldve never listened your XXXX president to your service in the military has nothing to do with me. Suffering from an XXXX  case of XXXX, I did not know a lot about what would come next, so it had a substantial negative effect on mefurthering my ailments   and worsening my XXXX XXXX experience I endured since my arrival back in the US. My initial response was to sit back and do nothing about it. I never retaliated, just went back to my quarters on base when the mocking commenced ( mainly from the fraud department and members of the OCA previously mentioned. It was like I was in the warzone all over again, listening to chants death to America. 

It's funny how we grew up saying "" sticks and stones my break my bones but words will never hurt me ''. It's all too sad because that is not true. It is unfair that people are treated unfairly because of the way they look or how they act or the color of their skin. Race, gender and inequality are major issues in our society. They determine how people are looked at, treated and or discriminated against. In my case, my XXXX  ( due to injuries incurred on XXXX ) was the joke of several agents at the OCA. I lost a XXXX upon my return to the US because of my creditability was severely diminished to the inaccuracies reporting on my credit file from Equifax. I was a XXXX ( XXXX ) and now Im a XXXX XXXX  amasses to a $ XXXX pay cut and 12  years of service washed down the drain. My commanding officers gave me a generous 6 weeks to adhere and clean up my credit files after I explained to them it was a computer glitch. That was XX/XX/2019, its now XX/XX/2019. For the most part, most of the accounts that have been fraudulently placed on my account has been removed, however, there are a couple that continue to linger. I was promised by OCA agents that within 24-48 hours the accounts on my file frequently, would be removed if a valid FTC report, police report, and/or any other supporting documents were made available. So then, I provided my FTC report, police reports and a copy of military ordersshowing that I was out of the country during the time of these discrepancies. Mostly, all the accounts have been removed as promised within 24-48 hours. However, these 2 accounts I was promised it would be removed in the same time frame, yet now Im being told I need to wait another 30 calendar days. Ms. XXXX/OCA,  I have been waiting to get this issue resolve entirely since XX/XX/2019. Hours turned into days, days into weeks, weeks into months, and we are almost at half a year. Further complicating, I have requested to speak to the supervising body of the OCA since XX/XX/2019. I called every day and have witnesses to vouch my credence. Each time, I have been told She will respond within 10 business days. Well its 12 weeks later and no call, no email, no mail from the this estranged Ms. XXXX. 


One thing that is learned fairly quickly during the span of one 's life is that life is often unfair. Unfairness takes shape in many forms and in every corner of the world. Life seems unfair when I turn on the news and see that innocent people are XXXX  every day, often just for the simple reason of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Life seems unfair when it seems that some people are just born into wealth and will never have to work a day in their lives, when it feels like I have had to work my whole life. This may be an unpleasant lesson to learn, but nonetheless, extremely important as it is integral to our emotional development and pursuit of happiness. Equifax and the OCA has made me, a XXXX  veteran, feel like the choice I made to join the US XXXX, the choice to defend freedom on every corner of Earth, the choice to choose a career to protect the innocent while providing a living for my wife and childrenone that a question each and every day. In the OCA members, XXXX, Ms. XXXX, and XXXX maybe on to something, that had I not risked my life for the country I so dearly love, none of this would have happened. We all chose paths, some narrow and some straight. I chose my destiny, my path and am beginning to regret each day with sombersome. I was hoping for a heros welcome home, instead I have been receiving nothing but admonishment and punishment for a computer glitch on Equifaxs behalf and serving to protect the venerable. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX"

( XXXX ) Exclusions.Except as provided in paragraph ( XXXX ), the term consumer report does not include ( A ) subject to section 1681s3 of this title, any ( i ) report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report ; ( ii ) communication of that information among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control ; or ( iii ) communication of other information among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, if it is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer that the information may be communicated among such persons and the consumer is given the opportunity, before the time that the information is initially communicated, to direct that such information not be communicated among such persons ; ( B ) any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device ; ( C ) any report in which a person who has been requested by a third party to make a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly to a consumer conveys his or her decision with respect to such request, if the third party advises the consumer of the name and address of the person to whom the request was made, and such person makes the disclosures to the consumer required under section 1681m of this title... Both XXXX XXXX XXXX  and PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) failed to meet and/or adhere to any of these definitions and violated my federally protected rights when they engaged in a monetary transaction to buy and sell my personal and financial information.

15 USC 1681b which states that there must exist a permissible purpose and that ( a ) In general, subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( XXXX ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. Neither XXXX XXXX XXXX nor PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) obtained my written instructions. 

15 U.S. Code 1681q - Obtaining information under false pretenses - In the attached letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, it states that XXXX  XXXX had no knowledge of how PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) obtained my information nor that they were attempting to collect any alleged debt from me. However, in PYOD LLC 's ( a non-affiliate ) response letter to the complaint filed with the CFPB on or about XX/XX/XXXX, PYOD LLC asserts that they "" purchased '' the "" debt '' from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. Thus, the two ( 2 ) letters conflict in how PYOD LLC obtained my personal information which was under XXXX XXXX 's fiduciary and material care from approximately XXXX to XXXX. This also means that PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) may have obtained my personal information under false pretenses and/or stole my information from XXXX XXXX XXXX , and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX was negligent in protecting my personal information. This also means that either XXXX XXXX Bank and/or PYOD LLC is in violation of 15 USC 1681r , which is punishable by a fine under title 18 and/or no more than 2 years in XXXX. 

! 5 USC 1681 s-3 affiliate sharing. XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX, and PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) have all violated this code as PYOD LLC and the XXXX are non-affiliates to XXXX XXXX XXXX, and one another. None of these companies had the legal right to share my information and violated this code. 

15 USC 1692b Acquisition of location, under abusive debt practices, states Any debt collector communicating with any person other than the consumer for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer shall ( 2 ) not state that such consumer owes any debt ; ( 4 ) not communicate by post card ; ( 5 ) not use any language or symbol on any envelope or in the contents of any communication effected by the mails or telegram that indicates that the debt collector is in the debt collection business or that the communication relates to the collection of a debt. PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) did violate this code by committing these acts. 

PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) also violated 15 USC 1692c ( a ) Communication with the consumer which states that generally, Without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, a debt collector may not communicate with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt ( b ) Communication with third parties which states ; Except as provided in section 1692b of this title, without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector, or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, or as reasonably necessary to effectuate a postjudgment judicial remedy, a debt collector may not communicate, in connection with the collection of any debt, with any person other than the consumer, his attorney, a consumer reporting agency if otherwise permitted by law, the creditor, the attorney of the creditor, or the attorney of the debt collector. PYOD LLC ( a non-affiliate ) violated this code when it reported to the CRAs, my alleged debt with XXXX XXXX XXXX  negatively affecting my credit score and overall creditworthiness. 

PYOD LLC violated 15 U.S. Code 1692e and 15 USC 1681q- False or misleading representations by communicating that they had the legal right to collect any alleged debt on behalf of XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX PYOD LLC also violated this code by asserting that a debt was still owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX, when in fact PYOD LLC had purchased the debt making the debt owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX  "" void '', "" cancelled '', "" redeemed '', and/or otherwise "" paid in full ''. I had/have no contractual obligation to PYOD LLC and have not, nor am currently engaged in any financial or other transaction with PYOD LLC XXXX Thus PYOD LLC falsely and misleadingly attempted to construct a contract where none existed. 

Due to these numerous violations of my federally protected rights, I am seeking federal and state remedies afforded to me under the governing laws and codes against the aforementioned companies."

A few years back I did have financial problem which resulted my having to hire an attorney and complete a Mortgage Loan Modification. I spent on this particular attorney approximately {$7000.00}. The Modification was completed, accepted by myself and Shellpoint. However, almost immediately I began experiencing problems with them. I have not missed one payment since, however, the company continues to send me notices of payments owed ( which I have not been or presently been behind ). They have changed the loan amount several times- they have constantly billed me for 3-4 months at a time without warrant and have been sending individuals to take pictures of my property. I have since hired several attorneys to rectify this problem- I am currently on my 4th as no one can seem to understand or resolve this problem or if it does get corrected it only last a month or two and goes back to the same nonsense. I honor my modification and pay faithfully every month ( receipts to prove ). They do not acknowledge ... .I am XXXX and still working at my same employment for 46 years ( thankfully ). I can not any longer take the stress of their incompetence, falsehoods - every time I get i corrected through an attorney the "" fix '' last for a month or "" two '' only. Something has to be done - I can not keep hiring attorneys for a "" quick '' fix - lose money for nothing. I have no family to fall back on- it is downright frightening to see someone pull up to your house and start taking pictures as if they were foreclosing - again I have not missed a beat and back. I am sooooo tired of receiving statements such monthly payment due {$9000.00} or some other ridiculous amount - no acknowledgement of regular payments. This is making me sick - I am constantly nervous just waiting for what is next - I need help badly. Thank you."

I asked the lady what was verified beside a address and she said my social security number as well as my date of birth I made her aware that this is a fraudulent account and she said well they verified my information so I asked her is there a contract or something that she see that verified that I had an account with them she said no but they sent over something and I asked her well if there is something I need to see it and she had no idea what was sent to them to verify that I had an account with the collection agency nor XXXX who is the original creditor after we went back and forth she said I still couldnt do a dispute so she didnt know what to tell me. I made her aware that I have contacted the collection agency and XXXX and neither could provide me with anything showing I had an account its fraud she said well they verified the account and she didnt know what more to tell me. I explained to her that this is the second time this has happened when it was time for me to get a clearance for my job Im in the XXXX and if she would have looked back 2 years ago she will she a different collection agency had this same account on top of a third agency is also reporting this same account she was no help very rude and refused to look into the account to see what type of verification information they had to show I had this account. I am starting to think that the credit bureaus are working with the collection agencies because there is no way that you can verify I had an account with my social security number and a old address its impossible. So therefore I had to take this a little further

I said "" no, I need to investigate this charge. '' I then called XXXX Hospital and found out they use this billing company and the charge was for the doctor 's fee. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent this company {$100.00} toward the {$240.00}, as I wasn't even sure if it had been submitted to my insurance. Then, on XX/XX/19 I receive a call on my cell phone from HRRG ( whom I had never heard of ) and they asked for my date of birth, which I refused to give as I work for a XXXX  and am familiar with fraud.

I then called HRRG and tried to explain the above events and they refused to acknowledge anything. They had no record of the {$100.00} payment I made, but I then paid the remaining {$140.00}. The person on the phone asked me to give her my address. I told her that the address on the letter they sent was my address and why did she need me to give it to her.

Petitioner paid {$25.00} on-site as a deductible and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX said they would bill his insurance. For whatever reason, they then began billing him for {$190.00}.

Worse, they have been levying "" fees '' and "" interest '' on a debt which had been paid off years earlier. Both Defendant 's have been notified of their errors and have refused to correct their actions."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"This is a complaint against XXXX XXXX. 

Here is the story in short : On XX/XX/XXXX I was involved in an accident with a vehicle I leased from XXXX XXXX. My insurance company, XXXX declared the vehicle as a total loss and advised me they would be paying off my remaining lease with XXXX XXXX. 
I was advised by both XXXX and my leasing company that whatever XXXX doesnt cover, my GAP insurance, which is mandatory by the law of NY, would cover the rest. 
I was in contact many times with XXXX and I was under the impression that everything was taken care of. 

Around XX/XX/XXXX I received a bill from XXXX XXXX for {$4800.00}. THIS IS THE LAST BILL I EVER RECEIVED FROM XXXX XXXX. 
I was surprised I had a balance. After many back-and-forths with both XXXX and Hyundai, it seemed that there was some mistake with the way XXXX adjusted the vehicle. Something to do with rebates. XXXX told me they would submit the balance and GAP insurance would cover the rest. 

I spoke to Hyundai many times. First they kept on telling me I do not have GAP insurance. I explained to them it is required by law, and it is also on my lease agreement. I was promised many times return calls from a supervisor. THEY NEVER EVER RETURN CALLS! 

Finally, they admitted I have GAP insurance, but for some reason which they could not explain, they did not want to file a claim with GAP. 

They told me many times they would call me to back to explain, but that never happened. 

I believe the reason they did not file is because, as I later found out, HYUNDAI OWNS THE GAP INSURANCE, and they do not want to pay it! So they just dont make the claim! 

My leasing company told me they never ever had such an experience with any other company. 

Anyways, I was under the impression that between XXXX and GAP, everything would be taken care of. 

AGAIN, AFTER XXXX TOLD ME THEY WERE SENDING ANOTHER PAYMENT, I NEVER ECIEVED ANOTHER BILL! 

Sometime later, I was checking my credit report with XXXX XXXX, and I noticed HYYUNDAI FINANACE still chowed me owing XXXX. I checked again with XXXX and they said they sent the 2nd check, and they dont know why it shows Im still owing the money. I called XXXX XXXX. They admitted they received XXXX check, but we were still disputing why no claim was filed with GAP insurance for the remainder. The reps didnt know why, and a supervisor was supposed to look into it and call me back. 

I was never called back. I emailed them and was not responded to. 

This argument was for the small amount XXXX did not cover. 

When I saw my Credit Report was still showing I owed the full XXXX, and it showed I was not paying it, I filed a complaint with the Credit Agency through XXXX XXXX. 
Instead of just correcting, XXXX XXXX did update the amount, but instead of just billing and discussing the remaining {$560.00}, they sent it an agency for collection, and reported me as over 60 days behind and delinquent on my payment. They reported it as a write-off. 

I WAS NEVER EVER BILLED FOR THIS AMOUNT. 

NEVER EVER!!!!!! 

How can I be delinquent on something I was never billed for?!?! 

I believe they did this in retaliation against me for filing a complaint through XXXX XXXX. 

As a side point, it should be illegal for the financing bank to own the GAP insurance. There is no oversite and they will never file. Why should they pay when they can just make up any excuse and bill the leaser! 

Bottom line : How can I be delinquent on a bill I never received?!? 

My credit score was killed because of them. It plummeted for no reason at all! They need to correct this!! Then they should be fined and reprimanded! 

I am attaching the most recent bill ( XXXX ) which was before they received a check from XXXX. Then the next thing I received after I filed a complaint. I did not receive ANY correspondence in between these two."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"XXXX ACCT # XXXX Pursuant to the Fair Credit Billing Act, A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose. This account is a billing error. This is not a refusal to pay but a notice that this alleged debt is disputed. I respectfully request your company provide me with documentary evidence validating this alleged debt. If no such evidence of indebtedness exists, and the only indebtedness is by agreement, you can not lawfully furnish these inaccurate late payments to the credit reporting agencies. The United States is bankrupt. If this alleged debt is valid, what authority do you have to collect this debt in the United States? If this alleged debt can not be validated and turns out to be an extension of credit, that would make the negative information provision in any agreement between us void and unenforceable. The continued reporting of these inaccurate late payments would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by collecting this extension of credit by unlawful extortionate means. And under the CARES ACT which is still LAWFUL and has forbearance and credit reporting requirements that may apply to my situation. Since there is no law under the Fair Credit Reporting Act requiring XXXX XXXX  to report negative information to a consumer reporting agency, your company is knowingly reporting inaccurate information to the consumer reporting agencies. Reporting information with reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act. XXXX XXXX XXXX policy does not supersede FEDERAL LAW.

I am moving through the application not fully understanding that this was an actual credit application. No where on the site or statement did it say if you go any further a hard pull ( inquiry ) would be required. I later called customer service to ask before moving any further and was told I should expect that it would be a hard inquiry since it is credit related. I followed up by stating that no where did the application ask for authorization to pull my credit profile. Also, the customer representative telling me the truth in lending statement states a credit pull is necessary and then once he checks and he realizes that it does n't say a credit pull is required, then he states '' well you should have figured that out '' is an unacceptable business practice. My response to the rep is that most alternative loan sites do n't normally do hard pulls so you can not assume all consumers will understand that. It is also misleading because no where on the site does it inform the consumer that a hard inquiry is required to apply. I do not want a loan and was only researching rates and would like the credit pull removed from my Trans union profile. I should not be penalized because the site is not transparent.

2. This account is listed as in collections it is still Reporting late monthly payment. As of now this account has 36 monthly payments but the account went into collections 36 months ago.

3. The current payment account status is 120 Days Late but the account is Listed as closed.

Pursuant 15 USC1681B
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 
1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 
2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 
4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 
5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 
6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ....."

Debt collection,I do not know,Communication tactics,Frequent or repeated calls,"I received a call from the number XXXX at work on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX. I was already in another ( work-related ) call, so I rejected the call. I called the number back a few minutes later, and the person stated the call will be monitored, it was an attempt to collect a debt, his name and the company name. I informed him that I received a call from that number, and he asked me for my name. Then he stated that he pulled up my records and needed me to verify the last four of my social security number.

Having been a victim of identity theft in the past and the increase in telephone scams lately, I was wary of giving him the last four of my social. I stated my concern and asked the representative what  account he was calling about to see if I recognize the account. He refused, stating that he couldn't divulge any further information until I verified my identity. He proceeded to ask me for my date of birth. I told him again that I didn't feel comfortable giving out my information all willy-nilly to some random stranger claiming to call from a debt collection agency, yet he couldn't even verify the name of the account in question. The representative proceeded to tell me, "" You not giving me any information. We already have it. You're just verifying it. '' From my understanding of the English language and sentence structure, in this context, "" verifying '' and "" giving out '' my information means exactly the same thing. I have no way of verifying if this person is who they say they are, and it wasn't like I was asking him for his company 's secrets. I was only asking for the name of the account in question, which I couldn't do anything with besides like maybe pay it off -- and, never in my adult life, have I ever heard of someone stealing another person 's identity to pay off the victim 's debt. On the other hand, with my the last four of my social, date of birth, AND address, someone could literally call my bank/credit card company right now and do some damage. The representative stated that he could not speak to me about the account any further until I "" verified '' my information, so I hung up on him. 

Overall, this representative from Midland Credit Management was  being shady."

I kindly request your assistance in resolving these matters and enforcing the relevant laws to rectify the violations that have had a profound impact on my financial well-being and personal life. 

1. Inaccurate Reporting of Late Payments : It has come to my attention that several creditors have reported inaccurate late payment information on my credit report, specifically : XXXX XXXX XXXX  : Account number : XXXX Please correct/update this inaccurate information on my credit report. To the best of my knowledge, this account has never been paid late. Your reporting is completely inaccurate, and it is ruining my credit.

Your reporting is completely inaccurate, and it is ruining my credit. You must update this account and delete the inaccurate information immediately. 
2. Unverified Debt : There are accounts on my credit report that I can not recognize and that have not been properly verified. These accounts include : XXXX  : Account number : XXXX Please remove it from my credit report. Kindly investigate and make sure this account belongs to me, because I can not recognize this business.

XXXX. XXXX XXXX : An unauthorized inquiry has appeared on my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, without my knowledge or consent. This inquiry was made by XXXX XXXX, and I have no recollection of authorizing this credit pull.

These violations have had a severe impact on my financial health and personal life. To provide you with a deeper understanding of the emotional toll this situation has taken, let me share my personal story : Due to the inaccurate reporting of late payments, my credit score has plummeted. This has hindered my ability to secure reasonable interest rates on loans, causing me to pay substantially more for essentials such as my mortgage and auto loan. As a result, I have been forced to work longer hours and even sacrifice time with my family in order to make ends meet. The stress and anxiety caused by this financial burden have strained my relationships and taken a toll on my overall well-being. 

Furthermore, the inclusion of unverified accounts on my credit report has left me feeling helpless and uncertain about the accuracy of the information being used to judge my financial responsibility. This situation has made me question my own financial literacy and has left me feeling unfairly treated by the credit reporting system. 

In light of these violations, I am earnestly requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau take action to enforce the relevant laws and regulations. Specifically, I ask that the following measures be taken : Thorough investigation and validation of the accounts mentioned above. 
Correction of inaccurate reporting of late payments. 
Removal of unverified accounts from my credit report. 
Removal of unauthorized inquiry by XXXX XXXX. 
Rectification of incorrect personal information, including addresses. 
I appreciate your attention to this matter and your dedication to ensuring fair and accurate credit reporting practices. I kindly request a timely response detailing the actions taken to address these violations. Please provide me with written confirmation of the steps that will be taken to rectify these issues within the timeframe allowed by law. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I believe that with your help, we can restore the accuracy of my credit report and alleviate the burdens I have been enduring due to these violations. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

Debt collection,Auto debt,Communication tactics,"You told them to stop contacting you, but they keep trying","I am submitting this complaint on my own behalf regarding attempted debt collection activities from PNC Bank. Back in XXXX of 2021, I received a notice from PNC Bank stating that I allegedly owed them a debt. I have NEVER entered into any consumer credit transaction with PNC Bank. I sent PNC Bank a letter by certified mail with return receipt that they indeed received ( See attachments ) In XXXX of 2021. In this letter I asked them to provide me with debt validation pursuant to the FDCPA. In this notice I also told PNC Bank not to contact me by telephone. I gave them consent to mail me any correspondences ( see attachments ). To this date I still have not received debt validation which is a violation of the FDCPA 15 usc 1692g yet they continue to mail me statements and demand payment. PNC Bank is also in violation of 15 usc 1692d. I asked for them not to contact me by phone in my notice to them in XXXX. PNC Bank has continued to call my phone all throughout the day into the late evening. I've asked multiple reps to note the account for them not to call me but the calls have continued. One rep even told me they would call me until they received a written request, which I've done. I am a truck driver who works various shifts, their calls break my rest all the time which could be harmful to myself and others as I have to drive over the road, they call me at work and other times which are ALWAYS inconvenient for me which is why I told them NOT to contact me by phone. This is a violation of 15 usc 1692c. Because I know that I never entered into a consumer credit transaction with PNC Bank I asked them to provide me with documented evidence that showed my alleged indebtness to them, the original promissory note and a letter of sale or assignment from the "" original creditor '' ( see attachments ) to PNC Bank, which again they have not provided. I am now submitting this complaint to the Arkansas Attorney General and any other regulators and legal counsel who will assist me in this matter as I have enough proof to move forward with legal suit for willful noncompliance of the FDCPA and seek damages."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),"I purchased my house on XXXX XXXX XXXX  for {$410000.00}. The bank 's appraisal was {$440000.00} signifying that I built {$25000.00} equity in addition to the 3 % down payment right away. The purchase price was lower than the actual market price at that time such that the agents suggested selling the house for nearly {$500000.00} which indicates that I reached the 80 % LTV ratio in the same year. Inflation added further to the value of the house ( see the market stats after XX/XX/ ) making me exceed the 80 % LTV ratio in the first year. I confirmed this with agents and applied for PMI removal. Penny Mac replied that they needed me to spend {$5000.00} improvement for my request to be processed or wait until we finish the second year to evaluate the value of the house just based on the Current Value ( no improvement required ). I asked what improvement they would accept but they gave me a vague answer asking me to spend money first and letting them decide if they accept the improvement later. My further inquiries about multiple improvements didn't help. For example, I asked if building a gazebo was acceptable, and they said no. Due to this complication and the wasted time getting me close to two years, I decided to wait until we hit two years and apply based on the Current Value. Once we did, I applied and they said I must meet 75 % LTV ratio. I consulted with agents and they said my house will confidently achieve this requirement. Their estimate of the value of my house, in the least, was nearly {$600000.00}. I applied for PMI removal and they sent an appraiser of their choice. She reported a faulty appraisal with serious errors ( e.g., unseeing a bedroom ). I composed a file listing all errors in the appraisal and asked PennyMac to redo the appraisal. They said we only redo it if there is an error in it and ignored the obvious errors I listed. I felt being a hostage to them and at the mercy of them so I told them I needed help from CFPB. As soon as I said that, they messaged me that they FIXED the appraisal and added a bedroom and solar system to it but that still doesn't change the value! Although this way they admitted that the appraisal had errors to be fixed, they refused to redo it. They asked me to send them 5 comparables instead. I knew this was a game and they are not intending to revise their decision but just to show they did a third review. I knew they would bring excuses to reject my comparables. I asked my agent to provide 5 comparables and I sent them to PennyMac. As expected, they rejected them for two main reasons, distance and different square feet. The comparables are all SMALLER in sqft than my house yet all above {$520000.00}. My comparables are closer to my house than the main comparable used in their faulty appraisal. In a reckless double standard manner, they accepted the comparables in their faulty appraisal but rejected the comparables provided by my agent. I attached all our written conversations ( including a comparison between their comps and my agent 's comps ), and the list of errors in their faulty appraisal as two separate files.

They appraised my house for {$490000.00} while the online tool on their own website estimated the value of my house to be {$530000.00} ( screenshot attached ). I needed a {$500000.00} home value to reach their 75 % LTV expectation meaning that they expected me only {$16000.00} to remove the PMI. All their and my comparables are above XXXX or XXXX. There are only two outlier ones below XXXX. The ones above XXXX are more similar to my house. My house is easily well above XXXX. We are talking about a huge difference between their appraised value ( XXXX ) and the actual value of my house ( say XXXX ) not something small that can fall within a margin of error. It is very fishy that they stick to such an outlier number below but close to the expected $ XXXX. In my latest recorded phone call, they said that they are the ones who decide, and even if the appraiser says that the house is worth $ XXXX, they can say no! 
I really need help from CFPB. I tried hard and spent months of conversations to resolve this with them but didn't work. I feel hostage in their hands. Please help. 
I would gladly provide more information if needed. 
Thank you!"
Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"A letter mailed from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, VA dated XX/XX/2022, indicated my mortgage loan was being transferred to Carrington Mortgage Services, XXXX, IN as of XX/XX/2022.

As I understand, I should have been given a 30 day notice of the sold loan and Carrington Mortgage should have communicated with me on about my payment options. With all the junk mail I receive to refinance my mortgage, I am leery of sending a mortgage payment to a company I have had not communications with or a valid account number. 

Doesn't the new mortgage servicing provider have requirements to notify me of my mortgage rights and responsibility for payment? 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX"

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"Follow up on Complaint # XXXX Need to speak to someone in person regarding my issue. When responding to my complaint through CFPB, SPS did not fully answer my concern. ***** Over the course of years, I have had one mortgage loan transfer to a numerous amount of servicers. 
These servicers have included XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, SPS. The later being the current provider ( Servicer ) During the course of paying off this loan, I have had problems with each of the above mentioned companies and the issues with each, have snowballed into a mortgage loan where my six month arm interest rate was not calculated correctly, mortgage payments not being applied properly, with missing principle payments altogether. Extra principle payments not being applied to the balance early in this loans tenure, in addition to drive by fees being charged and a foreclosure notice being sent, when I had never missed a mortgage payment in my life. If a judge ever saw the disaster of the supposed mortgage payment history ledger, a jaw would drop. 

I have many notes of trying to contact XXXX, but before they fully addressed my concerns, the loan was sold and this company, I was told went out of business. The loan servicing next passed to XXXX, D/B/A XXXX XXXX. Many phone calls where placed to this company and their executive team, but I was constantly pushed off and my calls were not answered. I have emails/ phone records to back up all my claims. When I finally did reach XXXX XXXX, the loan had transferred and it was communicated in so many words, that not our problem anymore, the loan has been sold I have been struggling with my current servicer to gain information on this mortgage loan due to an inaccurate loan balance. This particular loan servicer will not return any of my calls, after setting up phone appointments with their Ombudsman office. They simply will not call me back. The loan histories of payments and balances is extremely hard to decipher, with the balance going up XXXX XXXX in one instance ( in just one month period ) then down, with four ( 4 ) months of missing payments and the loan balance amount being close to the prior balance of preceding four months. What happened to my payments being made during all these months and the proper application of the principle being applied? 

I have dutifully asked SPS repeatedly for the mortgage history on the XXXX loan, but was told that they could not provide the data. A servicer should be able to provide this very important information to a consumer, as this is Federal law. I had made additional principle payments towards this mortgage back then, that are missing and unaccounted for. 

I have been trying to get all issues resolved with the current servicer and I had started the process last XX/XX/XXXX. Many Notices of Error have been sent to this current lender, to no avail, as with the other companies mentioned above. SPS is refusing to speak to me on the phone regarding the above mentioned discrepancies. 

This current mortgage servicer has a role to play in the violation of multiple Federal consumer financial laws, and have engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, and have violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), plus the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 ( HPA )."

Debt collection,Other debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"I sent a request to investigate inaccurate accounts on my credit report on XX/XX/2023. It has been over 45 days since I sent my inquiry but still have not received a response. I am writing to formally bring to your attention a matter of utmost importance concerning my consumer rights under the provisions of 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. It has come to my attention that a consumer reporting agency has failed to comply with the statutory requirement to block the reporting of information resulting from alleged identity theft within the stipulated time frame of 4 business days. As of today, 30 days have passed since my initial request for the removal of these items, and I am deeply concerned about this violation of federal law. I am a victim of identity theft and have taken the necessary steps to dispute and rectify the fraudulent accounts on my credit report. However, despite the clear legal obligation imposed by 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2, the consumer reporting agency in question has not acted in accordance with the law to promptly delete this information from my file. This situation is not only causing me significant distress but also threatens my financial well-being. Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that I have never provided written consent to any consumer reporting agency to report the disputed items on my consumer report. This is a direct violation of my rights as a federally protected consumer. Identity theft itself constitutes a lack of consent, and it is imperative that these accounts be removed immediately. Under 15 U.S. Code 1681b, consumer reporting agencies are permitted to furnish consumer reports only under specific circumstances, and none of those circumstances apply in my case as I never granted written consent for the inclusion of these accounts in my report. Please treat this matter with the urgency it deserves, as it directly affects my rights and financial stability as a consumer. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will take swift and decisive action to rectify this situation. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and a swift resolution to this issue."

A few months after that Wells Fargo started reporting me past due to my credit report and charging me penalties and interest. 

XXXX I worked on trying to get this issues resolved on my own. I had no issue returning the payment again to Wells Fargo and would have done so but they would not remove the fees and the payment would still be considered past due because fees would have been taken from the payment before being applied to mortgage. 

XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX wrote letters to Wells Fargo on my behalf trying to resolve this issue. During this time wells Fargo requested COPIES of two checks from XXXX Bank that they believed was where issues started. These were provided. But they still would not clear my credit AS IF NO PROBLEM ever existed. 

XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX had extensive written correspondences with Wells Fargo trying to resolve this issue. Through XXXX XXXX XXXX office both Arkansas XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Arkansas XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote letters to Wells Fago on my behalf. 

XX/XX/XXXX I met with a Wells Fargo Representative at a local office in XXXX XXXX Arkansas and this representative of Wells Fargo pecifically called Wells Fargo main mortgage office to see what needed to be paid in order to stop the bleed on my credit while this was being looked into by the state congressmen.

BOTH XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were involved in campaigns and elections during this time.

XXXX Bank responded that they could provide certified bank statements and routing numbers but that their system was updated and they could not provide the actual check copy. 

Wells Fargo refuses the XXXX Bank letters and certifications and my personal bank statements as proof that THIS PAYMENT was indeed paid on time and properly. I have a specific representative of XXXX Bank local main bank in XXXX Arkansas. 

This has greatly affected my ability to refinance my property of which I have over XXXX equity. I have above XXXX credit score even with the bad Mark of over 40 month rolling past due Mark on my credit by Wells Fargo. This bad MORTGAGE MARK on credit has harmed me in a huge financial way.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"In XX/XX/XXXX I was leasing and traded in a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, leased through Chrysler Financial ( Also known as Santander bank ). I traded this vehicle for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. A month later Chrysler tried to make me pay for the full year of XXXX Massachusetts Excise taxes on the XXXX Compass. I told them they had to file for an abatement with the town, and I would pay only what I owed, which was from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. For the next YEAR Chrysler continued to harass me to pay the full amount. Representatives from their company threatened to take away my current car, told me that the bill they were asking me to pay was the amount after the abatement ( which was a lie ). Non stop for over a year they threatened me. I finally filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney Generals office. Once the attorney general got in touch with them, they decided to waive the portion of the excise tax that I owed, but they deleted my entire account payment history from their web site, and despite the Attorney Generals demands it be reinstated, they refused. They lied claiming they could not reinstate it. They sent me a poorly written open ended letter stating the lease was paid, but something to the effect if any errors were found in later accounting they could still come after me for it. They refused to change that language in the letter despite the lease being fully paid by the dealership I traded the vehicle to. A few months passed, and I was alerted to a massive drop in my credit score. Chrysler had reported 120 days delinquent on the XXXX XXXX lease. I was NEVER EVER late with a payment on that vehicle lease. I tried to call Chrysler Capitol Financing however they've got my number blocked in some way now, that if I call, it transfers me to an extension that rings non stop and nobody ever answers it. I immediately got in touch with the Massachusetts Attorney Generals office again. I had been warned by another Chrysler Financial customer to keep an eye on my credit report, as he had done battle with them for his title, and for revenge, Chrysler put lies on his credit report. Now as a result of Chrysler putting the 120 days past due lie on my credit report, XXXX of my credit card companies drastically reduced my credit line with them, further dropping my score. My score went from Good, to Poor in under a week because of Chrysler lying on my credit reports. This will impact me for YEARS! My current lease with them ends in a year and a half and what they have done to me now will make it impossible for me to lease or finance another vehicle without paying substantially increased interest rates! The Massachusetts Attorney General got Chrysler to remove the XXXX day late remark from my credit bureau reports, but the damage is done. I only regained XXXX points of those lost by their revenge lie. The credit card company refuses to reinstate my credit line for XXXX days to to make sure the lie doesnt come back onto my credit report again. And if it does, they said they will further reduce or possibly cancel my credit card all together. I am a single and XXXX person, I work hard to make sure that I keep my credit score up, and Chrysler has absolutely destroyed my credit now by taking revenge on me for reporting them to the Attorney General. I am 100 % sure that by reporting them again to the Federal CFPB, they will likely take further revenge and hit my score again. What they did to my credit report was insert a remark stating "" 120 days past due ''. But the payment history still showed on time, and still said "" closed paid as agreed ''. However the creditors and apparently the credit bureaus themselves dont pay any attention to the fact its an obvious lie by Chrysler/Santander XXXX inserted for revenge purposes. I need help. The Massachusetts AG said she's done all she can with them. They refuse to comply by reinstating my payment history they deleted from my account, and I need something in writing from them stating what they did to my credit reports was a lie so I can get my credit fixed. They need to contact ALL XXXX credit bureaus and make sure my score is fully reinstated to what it was before they slashed it! I will never ever buy another Chrysler product or ever finance through Chrysler or Santander ever again. This has to be illegal what they did to me, and they need to be harshly punished!

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is attempting to collect on a debt I do not owe on behalf of XXXX. In response to CFPB complaint XXXX, they claim "" The debt in question are for the balances owed on a XXXX bill for service provided XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. '' On or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I filed complaint XXXX tactics employed by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX that cause disproportionate harm to individuals with disabilities in the attempt to collect on alleged debts. The only response XXXX XXXX XXXX could provide was, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  is a third party collection agency that works on the original creditor 's behalf ... '' Article 9 of Public Act 299 of XXXX, as amended was created, to license and regulate collection agencies operating in Michigan. Article 9 defines a collection agency as a person that is directly engaged in collecting or attempting to collect a claim owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another, or, subject to subsection ( 2 ), repossessing or attempting to repossess a thing of value owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another arising out of an expressed or implied agreement. MCL 339.901 ( 1 ) ( b ). I have looked for agencies licensed to collect in MI. I am a MI resident and am protected under the laws of MI. In this case MCL 339.901 ( 1 ) ( b ) applies. While XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is registered as a foreign entity to transact business in MI, they are not currently licensed to collect on debt on anyone 's behalf in MI, nor have they ever been licensed to collect in MI since registering as a foreign entity doing, conducting, or transacting business in MI. Therefore, any current attempt to collect on my alleged debt in MI, or any debt in MI is invalued, null and void, and has been since XXXX, when XXXX XXXX  XXXX first registered to transact business in MI. Current state records show they are registered under the nameof their President and treasurer, who in this case records show are related by virtue of their common last name. 

Since XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is NOT a licensed collection agency in MI, they may not be in the act of collection on debt in MI. The FCRA prohibits a data furnisher from supplying invalid and/or unverifiable information to a CRA. Equally, invalid and/or unverifiable information is required to be removed at a consumers request if that consumer can demonstrate the information supplied by the data furnisher is invalid or unverifiable. The MICHIGAN CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT also forbids Unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive methods, acts, or practices in conduct of trade or commerce under MCL Act 331 of 1976, Section 445.903. The account/tradeline corresponding to the the actions here are listed on my credit report as a collection account identifying XXXX XXXX  XXXX as the entity attempting to collect on an alleged debt. XXXX XXXX  XXXX themselves acknowledges they are trying to collect on an alleged debt. Yet, they are not licensed to collect on debt in MI -- they never have been and therefore, their actions constitute an invalid action that is prohibited under MI law and constitutes an unfair practice under federal law. In the federal realm they are at the very least making false representations to me as a consumer about who they are. They are registered to transact business for any permissible purposes the laws of MI allowe them to. Collecting on alleged debts is not a practice they may engage in with a MI resident without proper license. Consequentially, they are prohibited from collecting under 15 U.S. Code 1692f, which forbids collection on a debt that can not legally be done. In this instance, XXXX XXXX  XXXX can not legally collect on a debt because MI law forbids firms from engaging in that activity unless the firm is licensed to do such. 

Therefore, any collection action is again invalid prima facie and the annotations corresponding to such must be removed under the provisions of the FCRA. To do otherwise enables XXXX XXXX  XXXX to engage in practices that a CRA knows, or should know, is illegal and opens a CRA to liability."

This includes any information to a creditor that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no provided proof that it is."

XXXX XXXX XXXX has not supplied any proof of contract showing my signature of my identification, how the debt was calculated, or proof of purchase of the contract from the original creditor. They simply sent a computer generated letter on XX/XX/2020 demanding payment. I disputed the item with them and the 3 credit bureaus. I have yet to hear back from the credit bureaus after requesting a RE-INVESTIGATION. It has been over 90 days since the initial dispute. By law, the maximum time to respond is 30 days for a re-investigation. This negative account in the amount of {$130.00} is lowering my credit score and causing issues for credit approvals. My quality of life should not be lowered due to their mistake and not following proper Credit and Collection Laws such as FDCPA."

I feel like I have been breached through Equifax back in 2017. All 3 bureaus have different scores from each other. When I am able to look at old reports there is Inquiries that I haven't made. Also, in XX/XX/XXXX I had to file a fraud to my bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX  because someone set up an account in my name through money lion with a credit line and money loan and spent {$500.00} on gift cards through credit line and {$500.00} with a personal loan that went to a XXXX XXXX account.

Debt collection,Federal student loan debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX I sent via certified mail a notarized affidavit to ECMC ( attachment of affidavit is attached to this complaint ). As of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have not received a response from ECMC addressing all of my concerns nor answering all of my questions in my affidavit. A maxim of commercial law states that an affidavit that is not rebutted point by point stands as truth in law. ECMC has failed to respond to my affidavit. ECMC did send a response that was received in late XXXX XXXX but dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In this correspondence ECMC evaded all of my questions and concerns in regards to the alleged debt and alleged loan, except one. They attempted to address my concerns over the authenticity of the promissory note through an employee named XXXX XXXX from the Research Resolution Department by citing Rule 1003 of the Federal Rules of Evidence where it is stated that duplicates of promissory notes are admissible unless certain criteria are met. I have researched this Federal Rules of Evidence and I am challenging the authenticity of the copy of the promissory note which may possible be forged especially with today 's technology and software programs. If ECMC claims to have the original authentic promissory note, please provide a signed affidavit by an authorized representative of ECMC stating that they have the original wet ink signature document. Also, this attempt by XXXX XXXX of ECMC to address and answer one of my several questions and statements posed, is not sufficient. XXXX XXXX completely evaded my other questions and statements and did n't address the promissory note issue at all, but instead brought up an off subject matter that did not address the actual subject matter. I challenged the authenticity of the photocopy not if photocopies are admissible or not. Also, XXXX XXXX of ECMC needs to address all of my other questions and concerns. I have copy and pasted the text from the original affidavit and attached it to this complaint. There are eight (  8 ) itemized questions that need to be answered and addressed completely and not evaded. XXXX XXXX of ECMC only attempted to answer question # 5 out of the 8 itemized questions and statements and completely evaded questions # 1, 2, 3,4,6,7 and 8. <P/>Text from affidavit below : XXXX XXXX, XXXX ECMC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, MN XXXX Dear ECMC, This letter is in regards to an item/account being reported to the credit bureau ( s ). I have not received any correspondence from your company attempting to collect a debt. I have not  been given the opportunity to address this alleged debt with your company before you began reporting to the credit bureau ( s ). Please cease reporting this item/account ( alleged debt ) to the credit bureaus until the alleged debt can be verified. This is not a refusal to discharge any debt that I may lawfully owe ; In fact I agree to discharge any debt that I may lawfully owe, once the alleged debt has been verified. What is being requested as validation and verification of the alleged debt is listed below. 1. Verification of the debt, which includes the actual accounting 2. Verification of your ( ECMC ) claim against me ( XXXX XXXX ) ; that is a signed invoice 3. The contract binding both parties ( XXXX XXXX and ECMC ) Upon receipt of the above requested items, the proper actions can be negotiated between me ( XXXX XXXX ) and your company ( ECMC ) to discharge the debt. Until the debt can be verified, as mentioned previously in this correspondence, please cease reporting this alleged debt to the credit bureau ( s ). Thank you, in advance, for your prompt attention to this matter. The above text is from my initial correspondence sent to ECMC on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but the wrong address was listed on the credit report as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MN XXXX, so the original letter was returned to sender. After filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I now have the correct address, so Im resending the text from the original correspondence and also addressing some additional issues arising from ECMCs response to the CFPB ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ) complaint. In the CFPB response from ECMC, ECMC claims that on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX unsubsidized and subsidized loans were disbursed in the total amount of {$6600.00}. This is why I requested in my initial correspondence, the actual accounting for the alleged debt. What is being requested in regards to the actual accounting is verifiable evidence and records that reflect that ECMC or any other party ( financial institution ) actually loaned their own pre-existing money or assets ( including money or assets the Bank may have sourced from another institution ). In the CFPB response from ECMC, a copy of what was referred to by ECMC as the Master Promissory Note was also provided in the CFPB response. This is a copy of an alleged original document and may possibly be a forgery. Please provide the original wet ink signature document, so that I may perform my own investigation into the authenticity of the document. Also, until the debt can be verified please refrain from using you or your loans when addressing me ( XXXX XXXX ) ; this debt has not been lawfully verified, so that can be construed as defamation. It was also mentioned in the ECMC CFPB response that payments totaling in the amount of {$6100.00} were made during a duration totaling 76 months, if youre unable to verify the debt and that an actual loan was provided ; the total amount of payments should be returned to the party on record that made those payments. ECMC also claims that on XXXX XXXX, XXXX a default claim was paid in the total amount of {$3000.00}. Please provide evidence and the accounting of how this was performed. ECMC also claims that a Notice of Default ( NOD ) was sent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and another notice on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. None of these notices have been received by me ( XXXX XXXX ). Please provide the evidence that ECMC actually sent these so-called notices ; that is tracking information from the postal services used and a signed affidavit by an authorized representative of ECMC. ECMC cited several codes and statutes in their CFPB response that they claim justify their actions of reporting this item/account to the credit bureau ( s ). Those codes and statutes apply to debts that have been properly and lawfully verified. This debt has not been properly and lawfully verified, so please discontinue reporting this alleged debt to the credit bureau ( s ). Please answer the following questions below and provide the requested documents within 10 days of receipt of this correspondence. 1. Can you provide the actual accounting that reflects that ECMC or any other party ( financial institution ) actually loaned their own pre-existing money or assets ( including money or assets the Bank may have sourced from another institution )? 2. Can you provide verification of your ( ECMC ) claim against me ( XXXX XXXX ) ; that is a signed invoice? 3. Do you have and can you provide the original contract binding both parties ( XXXX XXXX and ECMC or any other party )? 4. Can you provide sufficient evidence i.e. tracking information and a signed affidavit by an authorized representative of ECMC that so-called Notices of Default were sent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX? 5. Do you have the original wet ink signature Master Promissory Note? 6. If the answer is yes to the above question # 5 ; was that Master Promissory Note used as a monetized loan instrument, creating a credit on account through bookkeeping entries that were then used to fund the alleged loan? 7. If the answer is yes to the above question # 6 ; the payments mentioned in the CFPB response from ECMC should be returned to the party that made those payments totaling {$6100.00}, since the Master Promissory Note was used as a monetized loan instrument and would have funded the entirety of alleged loan and no pre-existing money or assets were used by the so-called lender. The {$6100.00} worth of payments would be considered an excess amount collected and that can not be justified by ECMC or the alleged lender. 8. Would the above statement in regards to the payments totaling {$6100.00} be considered as a true assessment or not? For any of the above questions that are answered positively with a yes, please provide any documentation and evidence, signed by an authorized representative of ECMC. As mentioned in my initial correspondence, this is not a refusal to discharge any debt that may lawfully be owed, upon verification of the debt. If ECMC disregards and violates the law, further lawful and legal action will be pursued. If the debt can not be verified within the timeframe ( 10 days ) provided, this matter is closed, so please cease reporting to the credit bureau ( s ). Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."

I called back and spoke to XXXX XXXX about the matter, told her it was illegal to mislead me, that the statue of limitations in New York was three years for an old debt, and asked for my money back. She said that the mark has appeared on my credit as recently as XXXX, and that the account was only a couple of signatures away from litigation. I said that was still past the statue of limitations, then she agreed that was true, and in fact it was a lie and could not be sued.

Let it be known that insurance and taxes are figured into the monthly loan amount. 
XXXX bought the loan from XXXX taking it over in XXXX of this year. In early XXXX I received a check from XXXX for about {$240.00} for an overage in my escrow account. I did n't cash it because later that month I received a letter of demand from the town demanding payment for a year of unpaid property taxes ; there was an obvious error and I did not want to compound it. I got in touch with the town to confirm they had n't received the taxes and then contacted XXXX to resolve the issue. XXXX paid the town taxes. I then received a letter from XXXX stating that my escrow account has a shortage {$1200.00}. I contacted XXXX to dispute and was told that it was not their issue and I had to take the issue up with XXXX. I contacted XXXX and XXXX stated that they were not responsible because they had the loan serviced by Loancare for a short time, approximately a year. I am currently awaiting a response from Loancare. 
The facts are that I have faithfully kept my end of the deal and have also gone above and beyond by staying XXXX months ahead of scheduled payment. The XXXX variables, property tax rate and insurance premiums, have been audited on a regular basis and my mortgage payments were adjusted to keep pace. For this discrepancy to occur my taxes would have to have doubled over the course of a year, they have not. It is striking that the amount that is in discrepancy is the same amount as the property tax payments that were never received by the town. Loancare, XXXX and XXXX have taken no responsibility to make sure all funds, that I have worked for and provided, were properly accounted for, transferred or distributed as they serviced and transferred my loan between themselves. They are now trying to force me to financially compensate for their error/errors."

Public records information is NEVER validated by the Recorder of Deeds nor the U. S. Court system due to the Fair Credit Reporting Agency PRIVACY LAW.

My inquiry to the County Recorder of Deeds and U. S. Bankruptcy Courts confirmed Equifax Credit Bureau has never validated or verified these public record entries on my credit report, neither will they ever be by them. They further stated while they are NOT liable or responsible for any MISUSE or INCORRECT public records, nor the distribution of said information, public records may, and oftentimes are, reported by third party sources unawares to the consumer, and in most cases, incorrectly.

Considering the information indicating a Fair Credit Reporting Act violation, I need all bankruptcy information currently showing under my social security number to be PERMANENTLY DELETED from my credit report immediately.

The Credit Bureaus needs to provide me with copies of all documentation associated with these Public Record Accounts bearing either a court order to place this information in my credit report, or my authorization of release bearing my signature. In the meantime, to be in full compliance with the FCRA laws and guidelines, all the information listed under Public Records needs to be immediately deleted from the credit file you maintain under my name and social security number. Be further advised that I am closely monitoring my credit file. Per the Federal Law, you have exactly 30 days to complete this investigation as outlined per the Fair Credit Reporting Act 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Per the Federal Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ), you are required by federal law to verify through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( s ) all accounts and public information that you post on anyones credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail, email in fraudulent and erroneous account information. As such, if this unauthorized public record information is not deleted from my credit report within the next 30 days, I will be filing a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
Failure to respond in a satisfactory manner within 30 days of receipt of this certified letter will result in a small claims action against Credit Reporting Bureaus. I will be seeking no less than {$5000.00} in damages for, but not limited to : 1 ) Defamation ; 2 ) Negligent Enhancement of Identity Fraud ; 3 ) Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

When I call Shellpoint, the representatives tell me I have a commercial loan product and they will need to transfer me. They transfer me to a voicemail message that never returns my call. Also, their website does not function on the computer regardless of browser, and I have reported it to the company many times and they say they are working on it with no resolution. 
I recently found out that my property taxes are late. Not only are they past due but they are delinquent. When I purchased this property over XXXX dollars was collected for impounds. I have made my full payment each month on this loan, with the requirement of an escrow account, I have paid for taxes and insurance with my monthly payment to Shellpoint. There is no reason my taxes should be late or delinquent other than Shellpoint not managing my escrow account properly. 
I need help resolving this issue as I can not get ahold of anyone to help me at the company. Also fees have been accessed by the county for late taxes of which I should not be responsible for.

I demanded to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) you have on file. Under the FCRA, unverified accounts must be removed if you are unable to provide me a copy of verifiable proof. Despite three written requests, the unverified items mentioned still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. They have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"In XX/XX/XXXX I opened a loan for a business trailer in the amount of {$4100.00}. I had to file chapter XXXX   bankruptcy which was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. I filed a reaffirmation letter with the court for this loan from Sheffield financial. The court approved the reaffirmation and I have made all payments on this loan on time and as of yesterday, it has been paid in full. 

I have filed multiple disputes with XXXX  credit , XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  along with contacting the company directly. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX the Senior Vice President of Sheffield Financial which clearly states there was an error with my account and the reaffirmation letter was received just after they coded my account and failed to go back and re-code my account and adjust things with the credit bureaus. In this letter, he clearly states my account is current and they made an internal error prematurely charging off my account and placing derogatory information on my credit reports. He stated they would go in and fix this and adjust my credit reports in 2 to 3 weeks. He also thanked me for honoring my obligation with Sheffield as well as bringing this matter to his attention. All the disputes I have filed with the credit bureaus have been closed and either show no changes or in the last case of XXXX  Sheffield added a 3rd derogatory mark saying I missed last month 's payment and on XXXX  report say the following under STATUS- "" Account charged off/Never late. {$14000.00} written off. {$180.00} past due as of XXXX XXXX. '' officially the case says "" no change '' but the wrongfully "" charged off '' amount jumped from {$1400.00} to an absurd of {$14000.00}. This is outrages as my total loan amount was only {$4100.00}. 

I have all the documentation which I provided Sheffield 's internal dispute department directly as well as the credit bureaus and these errors along with the new errors have not been resolved in what I feel is a timely manner and only seems to be getting worse. I have been very patient and understanding but I feel helpless in this situation and hurt that they have been paid in full and taken care of throughout my bankruptcy. I have honored our agreement and made my payments and protected them from my bankruptcy only to be made to feel like I have hurt them. I also have a voice mail from Mr. XXXX which also acknowledges this situation and their error and an assurance that I will be fixed. This unfortunate situation has resulted in a negative credit score for me which is affecting me and stopping me from gaining new credit and loans that I currently need. Since I have started this process in getting this fixed I have only been hurt more and the original errors have been made more egregious and punitive against me. As a result, my credit score has dropped even more from their new errors. 

I have left messages for Mr. XXXX and spoken to account managers with Sheffield and have not received any callbacks from him and they all say he is the only one who can help me. 

I only want them to honor our agreement as I have worked hard to honor my obligations to them and have gone to great lengths to pay my loan on time and all throughout my bankruptcy and protected them with a court-approved reaffirmation letter. This process has been going on so long that they have now been paid in full and my obligation and debt completely satisfied. 

All 3 Credit reporting agency records need to be properly and completely changed to reflect There was no charge off ( {$14000.00} ), no derogatory remarks on my reports, my account is and has not been late, my account has been paid in full and fully satisfied as well as being in good standing. 

I understand mistakes happen, I have followed all the rules and requirements to address these errors and made myself available, provided all documentation the situation required to be resolved. As of this date, only additional derogatory items and negative remarks been changed by Sheffield. 

Thank you for your attention in this matter and I hope this finally resolves this very unfortunate situation."

In XXXX of XXXX, Wells Fargo Mortgage approved us for a remodification under the new federal law for FHA loans however charged us exorbitantly high capitalized interest ( noted as "" New Money '' on page XXXX ) in the amount of {$46000.00}. To be honest, we were both naively under the impression that our principal balance we remain at {$240000.00}, as it was before our filing of Chapter XXXX in XXXX. 

Since we have XXXX children, keeping our house was most important to us so we accepted the remodification and signed the documents at our local Wells Fargo Branch. We did not know we would get hit this hard in delinquent interest, other unknown fees, and feel Wells gouged us placing us well underwater on our loan. 

We also both feel we should have been offered a better finance rate than 4.25 %. If the "" New Money ( Cap ) '' was lower and so was the annual rate this could be potential difference of {$100.00} - {$200.00} per month. Which is a big deal to a family of XXXX in XXXX.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"My home is set for foreclosure sale date on XX/XX/XXXX by Wells Fargo. This bank failed to honor an existing modification agreement and then obstructed our efforts to resolve the matter. Their agents have made misrepresentations to us and their legal team along with our Attorney at the time colluded to steer us into a settlement agreement under duress. We immediately knew this was a mistake and have tried repeatedly to fix the problem but can't make any progress. We are inundated with several collection calls daily from Wells Fargo but when we call to try and fix this issue and get a review for homeowner assistance programs initiated we are ignored. We have been beaten down and broken by Wells Fargo and need help and need an investigation into their actions. We have the means to afford a fair mortgage payment but Wells Fargo will not consider this option as they XX/XX/XXXX to foreclosure. 

My wife and I purchased the home in XX/XX/XXXX with a predatory adjustable loan originated by XXXX and our monthly payment was {$1200.00}. My wife and I were both working full time and caring for our XXXX adult son. We soon realized that we had been misled at origination and that this was a toxic predatory loan. We contacted XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX they agreed to modify our loan and lowered our monthly payment to {$680.00}. Our agreement stated that we would pay this fixed payment for three years and then the modification rate and payment would revert to the current market interest rate. The problem is that Wells Fargo did not follow through with this agreement, and our interest rate went up to 7.25 % in the 4th year. We began the process of trying to contact their agents and resolve this matter but ran into a brick wall. We literally had hundreds of conversations that went nowhere ; we also applied for modifications several times. At one point we were offered a new modification, but the offer was made verbally -- we requested the terms in writing, since we had already been misled by Wells Fargo in the past, but their agents refused to put the offer in writing. 

Due to Wells Fargo 's failure to honor the original modification and work with us our case ended up in the court system. We were set to go to trial in front of a jury but at a pre-trial mediation the Wells Fargo lawyers ADMITTED fault and told us they would give us a cash settlement of {$40000.00} if we signed over our house within the next year. We did not want to do this, but our Attorney pushed us and steered us into agreeing to this under duress. We knew the next day that this was a mistake -- XXXX XXXX immediately wired {$11000.00} to our Attorney as we were trying to reach him to tell him this was a mistake and we wanted to fight and try and save our home and that we were pushed into this agreement. However, our Attorney ignored our calls and disappeared. We were once again on our own, and began trying to resolve this directly with Wells Fargo. Like before, we could not make any progress and could not get any type of review initiated. We were in limbo, and the only consistent contact we received from Wells Fargo was multiple daily harassing phone calls from the collections department. 

We are now facing an imminent foreclosure sale date and are trying to rescind the settlement agreement due to the fact this was signed under duress. Wells Fargo will not engage with us and will not allow us to be considered for any retention options, they have written us off. This is wrong, we have the financial means to afford a fair payment and this problem is a result of Wells Fargo 's failure to honor the original modification we received from XXXX. Wells Fargo has acted in bad faith and their actions need to be investigated."

Another profit would be if we decide to sell it because the resale value would go up, and even said it can go up {$29000.00}. We were alsotold that it had some tax benefits similar to owning a second home. We felt pressured especially when they said they needed "" corporate approval '' in order to grant me the price being offered it's our last chance at the lowest price. They opened a credit card for me but we were never properly educated of the fees involved. Everything was rushed especially when they didn't even gave us enough time to read through the contract and understand it's contents so we can be fully aware of the details of the agreement. They have our ID during this process. They offered us gift vouchers. We weren't properly informed how to cancel. We didn't even know how many days to cancel. I was XXXX and my wife was XXXX y/o at the time and we feel like our ages were taken advantage of. We have medical conditions such as XXXX, XXXX problems, XXXX  XXXX  etc & having this timeshare just doesnt help, it just gives us financial difficulties. Plus, they will keep on calling everyday.

As per 15 USC 1692g, I have not received a proper validation notice from the debt collector. The notice provided to me fails to meet the requirements outlined in the FDCPA. 

When the debt collector first contacted me, they did not provide me with a validation notice as required by 15 USC 1692g. Instead, they simply demanded payment for an alleged debt. The letter I received from the debt collector only contained the amount of the alleged debt, the name and address of the creditor, and a statement that I had XXXX  days to dispute the debt, but it did not include a clear statement of my rights under the FDCPA nor the steps I need to take to dispute the debt. This is a violation of my rights under the FDCPA. 

I am requesting that you take immediate action to ensure that the debt collector is held accountable for their actions. I would like for them to be required to provide me with a valid validation notice and remove any negative credit reporting until they have done so. Additionally, I would like for them to pay any damages that have resulted from their actions. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",Unknown,"In our XXXX end-of-year escrow statement, SLS told us that we had a shortage in our impounded funds ( due to reassessed property tax ), and told us what our new payment would be. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, SLS acknowledged receipt of a letter from us disputing the amount being demanded and offering an alternative payment plan. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, SLS sent us a letter turning down our alternative plan and demanding the original amount. 
While this payment amount was in dispute, we made our XXXX XXXX payment on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We paid {$2700.00}, which was not the new amount SLS told us to pay, but was more than enough to cover our principal and interest due for XXXX XXXX, as well as an increased amount for our escrow account. 
However, SLS did not apply the funds we sent to our account. Instead of paying first the interest, then the principal and then putting whatever was left into the escrow account -- which SLS holds as a service to us -- the entire amount was put into "" unidentified funds unapplied. '' This, in turn, made it look as if we had not made our XXXX payment -- although again I emphasize that there was more than enough to cover our principal and interest -- and we were charged a late fee, which I paid. 
I have been a homeowner since XXXX XXXX, and I have never once had a late payment. My husband owned a home for four years and never once had a late payment. NEVER. 
And we did n't make this payment late, either. The issue is the order in which the funds were applied. 
When our loan was first transferred to SLS, in XXXX XXXX, both our old mortgage company and our new company paid our homeowners insurance. XXXX sent me a refund check for the second payment, and I sent it to SLS to be reapplied to our escrow account. It took three months and numerous phone calls to get that simple thing done correctly."

Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,Unknown,"I am a first time home buyer and I purchased a home using Stearn 's Lending Mortgage Brokers in XXXX 2016. I was failed by Stearn 's Lending and the apprasial company because I trusted what I was told by both the apprasier and the mortage broker. The apprasier valued my home for XXXX without considering the roof and the bank allowed this to happen. I am now in a hardship financial situation now because the apprasier that was selected by Stearn 's Lending to appraise my home did not appraise the roof for any damage or age issues. I questioned my Stearn 's broker about it and told her I was not happy that the roof was not apprasied and how could the life span of the roof not contribute to the value of the home. I asked for the appraiser to be contacted and asked to go back and appraise the roof but she said they were not able to interact with the appraiser because they were an independent company. That made no sense to me but sense I was a new home buyer and trusted her information I believed her. Now that I have closed on the house, I learn that there are XXXX roofs on the house with a hole in the left corner and dryrot all around the whole perimeter of the house. I 've had XXXX roofers look at the roof and both said they would not patch a roof with that much dryrot so my only option now is to replace the roof. That is XXXX plus for me to pay when it should of been addressed before I purchased the home. The roofer also noticed that part of the outside wall of the back of the house was not wood but actually plaster! I was told that the seller did that cheep repair just to sell the house but when it rains, that plaster is going to start crumbling. The seller also repaired the master bedroom celing by spraying a sealant instead of using sheetrock. Once again here is something that should of been reported by the apprasial because it was visually accessable to him but it was n't listed at all. I want CFPB to look into my problem because I am in a hardship situation and I feel like I was taken advantage of. The value of the home could not be what the apprasier set it as with a roof with dryrot and a hole in it. I feel like there was some sort of fraud or neglect by the apprasier and the mortgage broker to protect me and put me in a house that is totally functional. Since they did not protect me it has left me in a financial hardship and a home that may incure structure damage and be inhabital for me and my son to live in if I do n't get this roof and wall repaired. I am devistated, please help me. Thank you"

Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was already discharged in bankruptcy and is no longer owed,"XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number XXXX According to my credit report, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX has filed a charge-off in the amount of {$5200.00}. In light of this, I am writing to express my concern about the lack of proper documentation associated with this charge-off and to bring to your attention a potential violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

As per my understanding of IRS regulations, when a creditor charges off an amount owed by a customer, it is required to issue a Form 1099-C to the debtor. This form is crucial for accurate reporting of income and compliance with tax regulations. To date, I have not received any such form from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I am concerned about the potential repercussions of not having the necessary documentation for tax purposes. 

Moreover, I believe that the lack of documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX may constitute a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The FCRA mandates that accurate and complete information be reported by creditors, and failure to provide essential documentation may result in inaccurate reporting on my credit file. 

In light of the above, I kindly request that you investigate the matter and ensure that XXXX XXXX XXXX provides the necessary documentation, including a Form 1099-C, related to the charge-off on my credit report. I am seeking clarity on the validity of this charge-off and require the proper documentation to fulfill my tax obligations. 

Please provide me with updates on the status of your investigation and any steps taken to rectify this matter. Your prompt attention to this request is greatly appreciated, and I trust that you will take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the FCRA."

I have contacted Equifax fourteen times, via certified mail, consumer protection financial bureaus portal, and Equifaxs dispute portal to dispute fraudulent accounts which were a direct result of identity theft, on my consumer report. 
Despite providing proof of the Federal Trade Commissions identity theft affidavit, police reports, my current drivers license and utility bill, and a dispute letter stating that the information/ transactions were fraudulent and not relating to any transaction by me, Equifax has failed to follow the law, conduct an actual investigation, and remove all fraudulent information from my consumer report. In accordance with 15 USC 1681 ( c-2 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ), Equifax should have blocked all information resulting from identity theft within 4 days.

15 USC 1681 ( b ) ( a ) ( 2 ) Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. 
Based on the above laws and circumstantial situation, I demand the deletion of the following account : 1. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), Account # : XXXX 2. XXXX, Account # : XXXX 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. 
As there are a multitude of inaccurate variations, I demand a deletion of all personal identifiable information from my consumer credit report with the exception of : 1. My Full Legal Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX ( delete all other names ) 2. My Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX ( delete all other addresses ) Please delete all other addresses, as I can not receive mail or any correspondence, nor do I have access to any of these addresses.

My only Phone number is ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX. 
Delete any and all other phone numbers. 
I demand my social security number and date of birth be removed from being displayed on the credit file for privacy reasons. 
Pursuant to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ), I am a federally protected consumer and I have a right to privacy. Not granting me my rights is in direct violation of 15 USC 1681 and all its subsections"

Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"I had a second mortgage with Wells Fargo ( {$110000.00} ). I had trouble when my husband was sick keeping up with our mortgage payments ( for 1st & 2nd ). I applied for a mortgage modification with both lenders. I was told by Wells Fargo that they wait to hear if the 1st mortgage approves a loan modification, then they follow suit. In 2013 XXXX, the holder of our 1st mortgage approved the mortgage modification. Upon learning that we were granted the mortgage modification, Wells Fargo converted our 2nd mortgage into a personal loan. They placed it in default and told me that if I did not pay the full amount they would foreclose on my house. 

Wells Fargo also filed for wage garnishment with the Circuit Court of XXXX County. I received a letter in the mail after the fact, but was not notified of the I had no option but to pull all of my money out of my 401k to pay them off ( {$77000.00} ). I also had to take additional loans out to pay off the full amount. 

By pulling this money out I lost my retirement savings, I took a huge tax hit. ( this is because they changed it from a mortgage loan to a personal loan ( without my knowledge ) ) Even though I satisfied the loan it is still on my publicly view-able court record for XXXX County ( as well as for XXXX XXXX XXXX County, because they filed in both accidentally ) I have email exchanges with their attorney XXXX XXXX admitting to the filing mistake and promising to fix it. It was never fixed. 

I had no choice but to pay it off as my job requires clearance level that I would lose if I had foreclosure or wage garnishments on my records. 

I have lots of documentation from this period of time. 

I made some phone calls at the time to try to find a way to complain, but was told by everywhere I reached out to, there was nothing they could do. I would like to pursue this at this time because as I watch the news I am learning there are more and more people in bad situation due to Wells Fargo and I like them held accountable."

Address on original lease agreement was entered ( by dealer ) incorrectly. XXXX mailed Welcome Letter with account information ( which is needed to sign up to their online site to make payment ). Address sent to had very specific need ; if not addressed correctly, mail would go undelivered. This was a brand new building that required we get our mail at the post office at times. I tried several times to obtain account information with XXXX and my car dealer ; was told each time I would get that information mailed to me. 

I was finally able to get the account number and register online and set up autopay. However, XXXX notified 2 credit reporting agencies of a 30 day late payment for two different months ; one was never notified. 

XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX - Late 30 Days XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX - Late 30 Days XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX - Unknown ( data ) I disputed this several times and was told the information was reported accurately ; however, the above information differs between credit reporting agencies and is not consistent. 

I attempted to resolve this with the XXXX and provided proof that the address used by XXXX was incorrect. They continued to say the reporting was accurate, ignoring any goodwill. They misstated that they used the correct address, adjusting their letters once I informed them of the correct delivery address ; they continue to maintain they used the correct address and said that nothing was returned to them as undelivered. In fact their first letter in response to my complaint had the incorrect address. XXXX made a simple clerical error, or the dealer did, and I addressed it as soon as I was aware of it but XXXX was unwilling to show any good faith in me as a customer and make a change to my credit files, something they have the absolute power to do. 

Since resolving the issue of the account number, my payments were made by auto payment and I sold the vehicle and the account was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. This negative mark, caused by their dealers error, has caused significant negative damage to my credit. 

Please note the letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX shows my correct address at the time. The letter states : "" Our records indicate, a Welcome Letter and first billing statement were mailed to your address of record being XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX. I have included copies of both documents for your review along with a copy of the Lease Agreement and account payment history. '' Also attached is the original Welcome Letter dated XX/XX/XXXX - please note the address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX ( missing is the calling out "" XXXX XXXX which is vital to delivery, unfortunately, but included in their letter from XX/XX/XXXX, falsely stating they sent it to the correct address. 

A second letter dated XX/XX/XXXX states the Welcome Letter was sent to the address on record listed on the Lease Agreement ( attached- please note the address ) ; however, the lease agreement address is incorrect, as entered by the original dealer. The letter states that "" numerous attempts were also made to contact you via telephone at ( XXXX ) XXXX ; however, were unsuccessful. '' This statement is troubling because since XX/XX/XXXX, I have 2 calls from GM Financial and 1 message, and that was in response to my complaint in XXXX. 

Also attached is a request for assistance letter dated XX/XX/XXXX to my Congressional Representative asking to assist in the issue with mail delivery. Specifically noted : "" USPS is not delivering our mail ; claims the address is unacceptable ; USPS has said they do not like that our unit number is more than 3 digits long. '' It took almost two years to have our mail delivery situation corrected.

Home owner initiated contact to get the loan roll over process initiated. Home owner did much of the work that is the banks responsibility.

This then created a {$4400.00} interest payment when our new mortgage payment will be {$3600.00}. Due to the banks delay, lack of preparation, lack of communication we paid nearly {$1000.00} extra in XXXX month and then turning around and having to pay {$3600.00} for the mortgage payment. This has been a hardship for our family and we should have never gotten to a payment that high had the bank done their job. On top of that at the closing the bank representative was a no show, leaving us with unanswered questions, frustration snd confusion on next steps. Current payment and future payment. After sharing with the bank we would need until XX/XX/XXXX for next payment when we would get paid again after already paying {$4400.00} there was no support or guidance in the process."

There was only XXXX program that fit the scope of modifying my investment property which was a Home Affordable Modification XXXX Tier XXXX XXXX. The other programs listed several reasons why I could n't qualify for the other programs but the Home Affordable Modification XXXX Tier XXXX ) simply said the debt to income ratio could n't be calculated within the acceptable range of 25 % to 42 %. Based off the underwriter using a gross rental income of {$910.00} XXXX based off XXXX lease and not XXXX leases for this XXXX building XXXX it was easy to sumise that they needed all of the leases. I submitted all the perpective information by the end of XXXX with updated information and all of the leases. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter saying the modification was denied. After reading again through all of much the same information I came upon the reason it was denied in coralation with the Home Affordable Modification XXXX Tier XXXX XXXX. It now stated that Chase services the mortgage on behalf of the insurer and can only approve certain programs. Not only was this statement not on the first denial ( hence I would have never reapplied ) but it gives the impression that Chase strung me alone putting me in a deeper financial bind when they never was able to offer me a modification on an investment property. The entire process started XX/XX/XXXX and I received my first letter of decision on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed by Chase that in accordance with my loan I could receive a modification on my investment property. Years later I find that they never intended on helping me but instead gives me misleading information, lies, ambiguious language, contradictory approvals and eventually sends me more in to a deeper financial whole. What Chase has done is not only morally wrong, but legally wrong to a homeowner. It goes against the principalities of what banking and Finance, consumer protection Federal bureau, and any other entity that oversees money and finance when it come to the public interest. Due to the uncertainties of the denial and the truthfulness of them Im still not sure if Chase offers a modification program for investment property. If Im to go buy the first denial letter I would say yes given the denial reason but if I was to go by the second denial it would be no which means this whole process has been not only a scam to further place a homeowner is a detrimental financial state but a waste of tremendous time. I also noticed that the eligibility data was not included in the new decline letter ( hmm I wonder why )."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"In reviewing the provided XXXX  credit Report forwarded to me furnished by XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX ; when concerning XXXX XXXX XXXX, it is clear the data is inaccurate and holds discrepancies. The report lists the date of first delinquency as XX/XX/XXXX. In comparison to the XXXX  Credit report pulled XX/XX/XXXX the first date of delinquency is XX/XX/XXXX. Moreover, as seen in the billing documents provided to me directly from XXXX XXXX  XXXX, the date of first delinquency is listed as XX/XX/XXXX. Though Ive furnished these documents in several occasions XXXX  refuses to properly update and remove the inaccuracies although they are aware the credit age exceeds 7 years and have also been advised the car was stolen in XX/XX/XXXX shortly following the primary account holders ( my brothers ) diagnosed XXXX XXXX. When speaking with an XXXX  customer care rep XX/XX/XXXX I requested the date when the date of first delinquency was altered as I previously recalled the account being reported prior to XXXX. I was advised the representative could not access my earlier historical payment history as all creditors/lenders reportings automatically roll off a credit file after 7 years. However based on the provided credit reports XXXX managed to remove 2 years of credit history in roughly 9 months and is clearly being dishonest about having accessing to prior account information. 

I co-signed on a vehicle financed by XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately my brother XXXX, the primary owner was admitted to a XXXX XXXX following our little brothers murder. During the time I was the resident of a XXXX XXXX  center and my brothers vehicle was stolen. My family was distressed by the sequential tragedies between myself, and my XXXX brother. They were not properly notified until years following XXXX XXXX. Several instances throughout my XXXX  I attempted to sort out the issues but due to recurrent relapse it was extremely difficult. My brother and I were both victims of identity theft. I contacted XXXX XXXX and requested information on the vehicle to proceed with notifying authorities. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX provided me a historical payment history displaying the first delinquency date as XXXX. They also forwarded a copy of the correspondence the sent to an unknown address in Arkansas which was provided to them from the thief of the vehicle. They are fully aware the vehicle was stolen and yet continue to report the inaccurate and differential vehicle history which is damaging my entire life. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX was found guilty of falsely reporting derogatory remarks on millions of there customers accounts. ( specifically altering the date of last delinquency and closed accounts ) Ive contacted all three bureaus and XXXX has since removed the account. Exquifax is in process and XXXX REFUSES TO REMOVE THE INACCURACY, Though Ive supplied the same information to ALL THREE bureaus. XXXX  also refuses to remove several inaccurate reports on my credit file, while both XXXX  and Equifax stated they received my initial fraud dispute from XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  and XXXX are deliberately ignoring the guidelines and laws that protect consumers. XXXX reported my accounts differently to ALL THREE BUREAUS. 


XXXX  also upholds that the bankruptcy they claim XXXX XXXX has listed is owned by myself. I have attempted to resolve this falsely reported bankruptcy. I contacted XXXX XXXX and disputed the information and was sent a correspondence stating there were no records for me. Again both Equifax and XXXX  have removed the false report as all three credit bureaus verify records via XXXX XXXX and there is no such accurate record. For several years Ive fought against this and its caused an unnecessary amount of additional strain on my recovery. To date, XXXX  is the only 1 out of the 3 credit bureaus that continuously fails to ensure my credit is properly reported."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the loan closing,"My ex-husband and I refinanced our marital home in XXXX with Pennymac. I was already on the title from XXXX purchase. I was not allowed on the loan. I was a homemaker without income. I divorced due to XXXX XXXX, the process was lengthy as my ex-husband sought to sabotage the process and my finances. Shortly after separation I heard rumor he put the home in XXXX forbearance despite being financially unaffected by XXXX. I pleaded with the mortgage co to talk with me, they could not because he would not cooperate. I was/am living in the home with our children. Divorce was final On XX/XX/XXXX. Final orders awarded the house to me in XXXX of XXXX. At this time I was able to communicate with Pennymac and began making payments towards a trial period to avoid foreclosure. I thoroughly explained the situation in great detail. I made every payment during the modification period and was waiting on the county clerk to issue a certified copy of the divorce decree. While waiting I was allowed to make the 1st payment towards the new loan outside the trial period and they assured me they had enough information to begin working with me. When I called to make the 2nd payment on the new loan I was informed they'd put it into foreclosure. ALL COMMUNICATION was being directed to my violent exhusband I asked them to please send copies of communication to the home on the loan and they would not. They would not add my phone number for contact for months. They would not communicate with me about modification. They sent that information to my ex-husband as well. I've been trying to save this loan since I was allowed to make my first payment in XXXX of XXXX they've refused to cooperate, communicate, or accept any payment from me. They have a copy of the special warranty deed filed with real property records and my decree. I've legally satisfied successorship. They've moved the home into foreclosure again. This home is all that I have in the world. I have good credit and steady income and a willing coborrower with steady significant income and excellent credit. They are unwilling to find a way to work with me. I have begged. I have cried. Everytime I call the phone is routed randomly to a representative and I have to spend a great deal of time explaining a very complicated situation. They have never once provided me with XXXX letter or document regarding the salvage of this loan. They took my money, but won't let me have my house. It has significant equity, but is in need of a great deal of repair due to my ex-husband. I am a single mother with a full time job for the first time in 20 years. It is my home. I am BEGGING them to take my MONEY!! PENNYMAC IS TRYING TO TAKE EVERYTHING FROM ME by continuing to perpetuate his abuse. This has complete control of my life and my financial well being and future!! I have called regularly. I have provided everything asked of me repeatedly!! Stop contributing to my violent ex-husband 's financial abuse!!! Ive been fighting SO HARD for SO LONG to get them to take me seriously, communicate, and accept payments from me on my house. It feels like they want my equity more than they want a roof over my kids heads!! MY EX-HUSBAND IS BEING GIVEN MORE RIGHTS WITH PENNYMAC DESPITE THE LEGAL VERIFICATION THAT THE RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP IS NOW MINE!!! ALL I WANT IS TO GIVE THEM MY MONEY FOR MY HOME!!!!!"

Debt collection,Credit card debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Around XXXX I opened a credit card account with XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  with an initial credit limit of {$300.00}. XXXX. After my first XXXX to XXXX months of paying on time they raised my credit limit to {$750.00}, after paying it off I noticed extra charges on the credit card and reported it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The person I spoke to said the charges were mine and I told him to turn off the credit card. I continued making payments but I kept seeing new charges on my statement. I called and complained again and the person said it would be taken care of. By not doing what they said they harassed me. 
They contacted a relative who told them I didn't live there and we were estranged. They were told that I don't live there and they should not contact them again or he would consider it harassment and turn it over to the attorney general. He was told his address would be stricken from any form of contact. For the last couple of years he has since been receiving mail in my name along with a court summons. This is in violation of The Fair Debt Collection Act. I feel they knowingly sent collection letters to humiliate me as a form of harassment. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I called again when I was getting ready to buy my home and seen it was on my credit report, I tried settling with them and they said they would only take the full amount due. I then explained what had happened but they wouldn't listen this is harassment. Since then it has fallen off of my credit report, but on XX/XX/XXXX it reappeared on my credit report under LVNV Funding LLC and the amount owed had jumped to {$1100.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX I called LVNV Funding and tried once again to settle this account by either payments or a cash lesser settlement amount at that time I gave LVNV Funding my current address and phone number. LVNV Funding declined saying they would only settle for the amount of {$1100.00}. This again is a form of harassment. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I found out from a relative that they had a letter from a law firm addressed to me at their residence. I had them open it for me and it was an advertisement of a law firm wanting to represent me for my court case on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX.I never received a notice from LVNV Funding about this issue. The court case was filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX, Missouri. I live in XXXX XXXX Illinois, a XXXX difference and a place I haven't lived in about XXXX years. This is again a form of harassment. 
I took off of work for the court date and drove there to find out that LVNV Funding had dropped the lawsuit on XX/XX/XXXX without prejudice. This has been a form of harassment for many years they will not work with me and keep holding this fraudulent debt above my head for almost eleven years. I feel like this court date is another form of harassment because they know I don't live there and by dropping this case and making me miss work is harassment. Then receiving the cancellation of the case by letter after the court date at the wrong address is harassment."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"I have a problem with XXXX XXXX my mortgage company. They put a 30 day late notice on my credit report because my taxes went up and I did not know about it so my payment came out of my bank automatically as it does every month for the same amount not the new amount. If I had known about this I would have fixed it right away. The only way I found out about it was through a notice from the credit bureaus which I monitor daily because I am trying to secure a loan to build a new home and need my credit score as high as possible. As soon as I got the noticed I called XXXX and paid the {$80.00} difference. I asked them to remove the late and they said no because its accurate and they tried to contact me. I have NOT spoken to anyone from XXXX XXXX  about this issue prior. They said they sent letters and made phone calls. The only things I received from them is calls to refinance my mortgage which I have told them numbers time I do NOT want to do. 
First I spoke to : XXXX XXXX Team Leader XXXX She said the information was accurate and she would not be able to do anything about it. After requesting to speak to her superior for 5 minutes she finally transferred me to someone else. That someone else was : XXXX XXXX Team Leader Account Resolution XXXX I was very disappointed when I asked for a superior I received someone with the same title. I told her my story and she would not help at all either. I again asked for a supervisor and she was even more defiant. After about 5 minutes of requesting a supervision she finally told me she would have someone call me back. 

In the mean time I took to XXXX to message them and post about my complaint on their page. I immediately received a response that they were sorry and would try to resolve the issue. I was told to email : XXXX XXXX then called me and said he would discuss with the higher ups and would call me back An hour later I received a phone call from : XXXX XXXX Servicing Escalation Specialist XXXX He told me same thing the others did that it was my fault and they would not change the credit report. 

I am extremely upset about this. I have not missed a payment with them in over 5 years and been an outstanding customer and over something I had no idea about and wasn't my fault they refuse to help me or even work with me. They claim to be # 1 in customer satisfaction well definitely not this time. 

I then reached out the the credit bureaus to see if there is anything they can do. They told me I can file a dispute but all that is going to do is go back to XXXX XXXX to verify if the information on my report is correct and we already know they are going to say yes. 

As a consumer I fell trapped and helpless. My score dropped over 50 point and no one will ever give me a loan with a missed payment on my record and I did not miss a payment. The payment came out of my account automatically like it does every month. I paid my bill! ( See attached ) I have no recourse because the only one that has any say or power over this is XXXX XXXX and they have made it clear they will not change this or work with me on this. So I am forced to accept this even though I feel it is completely wrong. I won't be able to get a loan for my new house all because of something I had no idea about. I have been working for years to get my credit repair and now all of that is down the drain because of this. 

PLEASE HELP!"
Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Problems when you are unable to pay,Unknown,"Since XX/XX/XXXX, it appears Regional acceptance has not been honest with me regarding my balance, the balances due, interest accrual and what my payments are applied while at the same time not providing me with statements. I have spoken with several reps and each provide conflicting information and confirmed they were not sure what the fees were. If reps for Regional Acceptance are not aware of what the fees were for how could the customer. A representative recently contacted me and indicated my account was 50 day past due and the amount of {$1600.00} due. This balance confused me since my payments are {$440.00} a month. I asked the representative what made up the {$1600.00} and the rep did not know. the rep indicated she would research and call me back. She did n't return my call but other reps continued to call and I would ask them what made up the {$1600.00} since my payments were {$440.00} a month and each would indicate they were fees but could not provide information on what the fees were and the amount of the "" fees '' s. Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a rep name XXXX who informed me that the {$1600.00} due was made up of {$120.00} remaining from XX/XX/XXXX, {$440.00} for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2017, {$21.00} in late fees and {$150.00} in check fees. this is a total of {$1600.00}. I asked was this all the fees. XXXX indicated yes and this is why {$1600.00} was due. I then asked about the {$450.00} payment received on XX/XX/XXXX, the {$900.00} payment received on XX/XX/XXXX and the {$400.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX confirmed receipt of the payments but indicated those payments were applied to the separate interest that runs at the same time as the interest on this account. XXXX confirmed the {$900.00} and the {$400.00} payments were not applied to the interest, the principal of the loan, the late fees nor the returned check fees but to some other interest that I was never informed of. I spoke with a rep today in client services named XXXX who again provided different information and indicated that my account had been delinquent when I accepted a defferment of 2 payments in XX/XX/XXXX and payed {$230.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX, my account was 2 months behind and a rep contacted me and informed me that a little over {$1000.00} was due. He said I could resolve by doing the differment and paying {$230.00}. He indicated my account would be current. However, XXXX informed me today that those actions did not bring my account current and that {$1000.00} was due in XXXX. I have spoken with a representative of regional each month and I was not informed of this delinquent balance or this other running balance of interest until XX/XX/XXXX when I spoke to XXXX. Also, the rep I spoke with in XX/XX/XXXX used the phrase 'this will bring your account current ''. this lead me to believe the account was update and there was not a balance due at that time. however, XXXX indicates today that was not correct. Also, when I spoke with a representative on XX/XX/XXXX and paid {$450.00}, the representative did not indicate I have a {$1900.00} balance. However, XXXX informed me today, that was the amount that was due at that time. Representatives have been misleading and/ or untruthful or was not well versed in the information they were providing. also, I have not been provided statements so I can monitor balance.

Are you familiar with something called 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i ( a )? I heard that if you cant provide proof then these XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) accounts must be deleted. So, I am requesting them to be deleted because they are NOT 100 % accurate. So, could you please investigate and get back to me? I know from reading an FCRA lawyers site that you have XXXX days to complete this investigation. 

Again, investigate these accounts and remove them if anything is missing or not correct on them.

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"I applied for a mortgage forbearance with XXXX XXXX effective XX/XX/XXXX I opted to extend it for a year total. 
I opted for a Loan Modification, it took time for them to send the paperwork and schedule a notary, modification was official in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX told me to make payments while it was being processed. I made payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. During this time the modification was not officially implemented. I called every month to check in with everything and make my payments. I made the exact payment they told me to make over the phone. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I receive notification my loan is being sold to Lakeview XXXX XXXX. Lakeview XXXX XXXX tells me I need to make payments while the paperwork is processed. I call 1-3 times a month checking on it and making the monthly payments they told me to make. The modification is not processed until XX/XX/XXXX. I made every monthly payment during this time. I called every month to escalate getting my modification processed. 

In XX/XX/XXXX Lakeview XXXX XXXX says I owe an overdue balance of {$3000.00}. I call and tell them this must be an error because I have made every monthly payment. I called twice a month from XXXX - XXXX. They said they were working on the error and escalating the issue. I make every monthly payment during this time. 

Then in XX/XX/XXXX they report me as delinquent to the credit agencies and this destroys my credit. It was above 800 and now is around 650. I call again and again and they said they can't tell me what they issue is and are continuing to escalate the issue. I had a few times where they promised to call me back when they had more info, and they never did. I keep calling and making my monthly payment and asking on more info on the issue. 

I call again in early XXXX to push the situation further because my credit score still shows as delinquent, even though I am making every monthly payment. I reach someone in the customer service department that researches these sorts of things. They tell me that XXXX XXXX applied 2 payments I made at the end of XXXX into "" unapplied funds '' instead of applying it to a payment. This is the first time I have ever heard of "" unapplied funds '', when I made the payments with XXXX XXXX over the phone they said it was being applied to the payments. So those came over to Lakeview XXXX XXXX as unpaid months. He tells me there is nothing that can be done to correct this and I have to pay the overdue balance to make my account current. I empty my savings to pay this overdue balance as I want it corrected with the credit agencies. I now think this nightmare is over. 

Then I receive a letter XX/XX/XXXX from Lakeview XXXX XXXX that my account is past due. I check online and the entire loan modification has been reverted back to the old interest rate and with around {$20000.00} due. I call Lakeview XXXX XXXX immediately. They tell me there was an error with my modification but can not tell me what the error is. They said they need to reach out to XXXX XXXX and re-do the whole modification. I push them that this needs to be resolved. I ask about the {$3000.00} XXXX paid in XXXX, that was on top of my monthly payment that I also paid, and they said that will be put in "" unapplied funds '' and put towards the principal. At this point I am absolutely furious. I emptied my savings to pay this to get my account corrected and credit score corrected. I tell them that they MUST apply this to either future payments or refund the amount. They note that is my account but say they can not guarantee it. They say I shouldn't make my XX/XX/XXXX payment as it will likely end up in "" unapplied funds ''. And that I need to wait. But they have been telling me this for 8 months, they tell me over and over that it will be processed in 10 days but it's been months at this point. 

This has been 8 months of XXXX, and almost a year if you count in XXXX XXXX as well. I signed my modification and have made every single payment to both companies. I even paid the $ XXXX overdue balance that wasn't an actual overdue balance."

This aroused my curiosity and I did some research and found that Mr. Cooper was disciplined by you the CFPB in XXXX for sending inaccurate paperwork and reporting on their loans that they serviced. 
I also found out that in XX/XX/XXXX The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Issued statements for the Services and banks to work with customers on loan modifications including reinstating established loan modifications. 
I believe that Mr. Cooper is creating this paperwork to show the FED that they are working with customers when they actually are not. I ask that you investigate this matter ( see attached Complaint letter set to Mr. COOPER"

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"since being with chase bank, I had tried to modify my loan. They had me apply several times a year over the course of many years. The end result was always the same. I did not make enough money to do a modification. Approx. 2010, I contacted Senator XXXX XXXX 's office about this issue and what I could do, as interest rares were soooo low, I could modify for about 200.00 a month! He told me about a special program and had me meet with Chase Bank. I met with XXXX XXXX And XXXX XXXX, and they were awesome! After lots of hard work on their part, they called me with "" The Best XXXX Present I would EVER receive! '' They told me to sit down, and said, from now on I did n't have to make another house payment as long as I lived in the house! Chase approved a "" special program just for me '' which would charge me interest only on the principle of XXXX dollars left on the loan. Because I lived on so little money, the payment would go in to an account ( the payment was about 200.00 a month or less depending on the interest rate, and it would just be the interest, / XXXX, XXXX came to my house and met with me, my sister XXXX, her husband XXXX, and my mom was on the phone conference call as well. They explained that only the interest would be added to the account, and no extra interest would be charged to that account, as the interest was being charged every month on the principle. already. Because I had so much equity in the home, they felt this was a VERY safe deal for them and worked out well for me by not having to worry about paying it until I passed away or sold the home, in which they would be paid in full. It was explained so everyone understood. They were here for over 2 hours.. This has been in effect since approx. XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. They had me paying XXXX a month for taxes and insurance, that went in to an escrow account for them as I was paying those myself. It set up an escrow acct for almost XXXX dollars. that they have. I have been paying the taxes and Ins myself, so the excrow money has not had to be touched.. Every couple years they send me paperwork, asking me if everything was the same, and I would answer yes, it is all the same, since we have not had a cost of living raise in ages.. THis past XX/XX/XXXX, they actually sent a man up ( my neighbors actually noticed hi sitting outside my house and approached him asking him what he was doing. My neighbors are very protective of me as they know I live alone and am XXXX, so thank god for them all. they take very good care of me! The man from chase bank finally came up to the door, when he saw me outside in XX/XX/XXXX. I introduced myself to him and asked him if he wanted to come in and see the house, which he declined. Then XXXX XXXX from chase bank called about a week later, leaving a message saying for me to call her at a number she left ... then added : nevermind, disregard this call '', as the man from the bank said everything was fine, since they knew I was living in the house, nothing had changed and everything was fine. Then last week, I received a phone call from chase bank, asking if I wanted to keep the house ( which I had just told them I DID a few weeks before?! ) I told them I had a special program they made just for me and gave them the list of all the people who I had worked with from XXXX XXXX to XXXX paycheck and the man who drove up from calif. who all just approvedit. Even though it does n't have to be pre approved unless there is a change in my income, which therehas not been because we have not received any XXXX raisings in a decade. XXXX XXXX said whe I called, that the program I was n did not exist, and I said it most certainly did as I had been a part of it for many years. She argued with me that it did not and that they wanted to offer me a modification of XXXX a month and was n't that great?! well yes it would be great, IF I made more than XXXX a month! Remember the whole reason they made this special program for me was because they said I did not make enough money to do a modify I had been trying to do for may years prior when interest was next to nothing and would have been like XXXX a month! I can not afford XXXX. a mnth and pay taxes and ins and buy groceries, my medications and pay my utilities! Thus the special program I am in. Chase bank reported me to the credit beurus and I tokkan awful hit, after working so hard to get my credit built up. They sent me back my payments back for years if I tried to make one, because I am on this special program. They know I am on this and the terms of it are as long as I live in the house or until I sell it. The severe stress of living like this has me so very sick! they know the deal they invented and implemented for my special circumstances, took the money from the GOVT to help me, yet have put me through XXXX time after time. In fact when I told my mom about this last Tuesday, she ended up having a XXXX XXXX!! The stress and worry she suffers worrying about me and the XXXX chase bank keeps putting me through is making us both sich! Chase needs to fix myt credit score by removing what they put on my account about not paying because it is not true under the infinite long term agreement we have had for the past several years. I can not keep going through thisas it makes me sick and my mother sick! and is not fair to us! With a XXXX  XXXX like I suffer, staying stress free is vital to my health. My XXXX was XXXX at the dr last week! they wanted to put me in the hospital yet again because of all this XXXX! PLEASE, just honor your own agreement that you came up with and let me live my life in peace. Remove the deroggotory remarks on my credit report and restore it back to wat it was. thankyou!"

I'm coming to you for assistance because I don't know what else to do anymore. I've been trying to get accounts deleted from my credit report for the last three months and the credit bureaus keep the accounts on the report. There should be no reason why these accounts should remain on the credit report since I have a deletion letter from the collection agency that these were supposed to be removed back on XX/XX/XXXX. This letter even has AUD deletion control numbers on it. 

I have contacted the credit bureaus myself and have submitted this letter as proof these accounts should be deleted. They still remain. We are now on XX/XX/2022, and these accounts are STILL on my reports. To make it even worse, they were deleted for a short period of time, and then reappear. I've called the collector to figure out what is going on, but they have submitted an AUD deletion request three times to the credit bureaus. At this point, I have no choice but to file this complaint through you otherwise I will have to file a complaint through my local small claims court. Please, please, please get the credit bureaus to do their jobs. We aren't in a pandemic anymore, so there is no excuse as to why this hasn't been done by now."

I received the phone, but never ported my existing number over. I had difficulty doing so and when I called XXXX to help me with this I received no help. In the meantime, a new number was issued to this phone by XXXX. I was not aware of this and did not consent to this. Apparently monthly billing was started immediately on this new number that I had no knowledge of nor did I give consent to. Months later, when I discovered a new number had been issued and billing charged I called XXXX to correct this. This was supposed to be corrected and I do not know why it wasn't. I offered to pay XXXX the amount due for the phone which was {$1100.00} This was for the actual phone amount and not the billing for a service I did not sign up for. The bill was sent to collection agency McCarthy, Burgess, and Wolfe.  After speaking to XXXX employee XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX she agreed I should not have been charged for the extra charges and need to pay only the phone amount of {$1100.00}. She advised me to ask McCarthy, Burgess, and Wolf to open a dispute from the the time the service was opened to the time it was written off. She agreed that since there was no phone usage I should not have to pay for this. The reason she could not make this change herself is because my account had already been sent to McCarthy, Burgess, and Wolfe and they would then have to send it back to XXXX so XXXX could amend this. I called McCarthy, Burgess, and Wolfe on XX/XX/XXXX and left message with XXXX XXXX to do this. I was told a dispute would be opened and XXXX would be contacted. McCarthy, Burgess, and Wolfe have not done this and it has now been 28 days. I have also not received any form of communication from them since I asked a dispute to be opened. They promised an update would be sent. I spoke with XXXX XXXX today and they confirmed they have not received a dispute action from McCarthy, Burgess, and Wolfe. Further, McCarthy,  Burgess, and Wolfe employee XXXX XXXX told me if I paid a reduced agreed upon pay off amount on the phone I would then own the phone. This was not correct information. Upon confirmation with XXXX I was told after paying this amount of {$920.00} I would not own the phone and still would not be able to use it. 
In conclusion, McCarthy, Burgess, and Wolfe have refused to open a dispute on my behalf investigating this incorrect collection. I have a legal right for this to be done and so far they have refused. They have also stated false and misleading information to me in order to collect a debt."

I am waiting on 3 more XXXX debts to be re-deleted form XXXX, the first one that popped up on XXXX they had it off the very same day it popped up when I called, the next day XXXX placed 3 more deleted debts back on XXXX report. We will see what happens. XXXX does n't do anything like the other two do. They are slow to respond, and never send proof they deleted, disputes go unheard unanswered and forgotten. That 's why I have no paperwork from results of disputes to submit on this complaint from XXXX because they never give me any! I called XXXX today and was hung up on after being placed on hold for half hour- While trying to dispute XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX PART. Meanwhile at least the other two XXXX and EX are trying to help me I feel like XXXX  just does n't care. All these debts I am talking about has been deleted at one point, and re-added. Please somebody help make these many inaccuracies go away for GOOD, ONCE AND FOR ALL OFF ALL 3 REPORTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. It 's a juggling act and I 'm not going to stop until it is corrected!"

PLEASE HELP!!!!!"
Debt collection,Mortgage debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I am opening another complaint as incorrect check with date submitted in previous document. 

Arvest Mortgage has shown a repeated pattern of not processing payments timely. My property management company sends out the mortgage payment every day on the first or second of the month with documented proof. Arvest 's own statement shows as recently as XXXX of XXXX, it took until the XXXX to process the payment. Mail does not take 11 days. In XXXX of this year, it took 10 days. Again, this shows Arvest has a history of either mail delivery issues or delayed processing. 

The proof I have that payment was mailed in time is the following : 1. Email confirmation from management company that check was sent out on the first.

2. A statement produced on XX/XX/XXXX from management company showing check was mailed on XXXX from their automated accounting system. This would have been before any late period.

3. The copy ( correct one this time ) of the check dated XXXX. 

So, for Arvest to be correct in their assessment, my management company would have had to produce a false statement from their automated system on XX/XX/XXXX saying they mailed the check when the didn't to cover up an issue. This of course would have been unnecessary because they could have just called and done a phone payment to have payment processed in time.

Arvest has yet to produce any documentation other than when they PROCESSED the payment to suggest they did not receive the payment in time. Again, this is after years of on time payments from me and inconsistent processing times by Arvest.

Further, in the latest response Arvest mentioned that they tried repeatedly to get a hold of me. This is blatantly false. I received no phone calls or emails from Arvest other than the ones they market to me constantly asking if I want to refinance which I would never do with Arvest since I didn't choose them to begin with and their extremely poor customer service would never want me to stick around with them. I would love to see any phone or email records from Arvest saying they tried to reach me. I would also love for them to stop sending my unsolicited refinance emails. 

Finally, I am including as evidence that I am not the only one Arvest continually abuses. These two screenshots are just a sample of frustrated customers whose mailed checks somehow disappeared or were processed incorrectly. 

So, to recap the proof I am clearly able to provide from a verifiable third party : * Management company has produced a dated check on XXXX. ( attached ) * Management company 's own automated report generated on XX/XX/XXXX shows check was sent on XXXX. ( attached ) * Management company 's written correspondence verifying the above. ( attached ) I want Arvest to produce ANY evidence that payment was late that was a direct result of me ( and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) not paying timely and not their own negligent operations because, again, the previous response from their own systems shows how long previous payments has taken to process. I have a system from USPS that sends me an email of mail I receive every day. Can Arvest produce something similar? If so, I will take issue up with my management company. If not, I am prepared to take any action necessary to see Arvest doesn't hurt another person with their bad internal processes."

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",Unknown,"I purchased my property from HUD in XXXX with an FHA rehab loan through XXXX. After closing the loan I expected to receive a welcome package, mortgage statement with bill and address etc. However this never came. I tried to contact the bank to find out what was going on and they told me that the construction loan had not been released. I did not understand what this meant and tried to just begin making my payments on the loan. However, they would not accept my payment and told me that I was in foreclosure. I have tried repeatedly over the last few years to straighten this situation out but it is if I am invisible. The lender claims that none of this happened, then the loan got transferred to XXXX or XXXX. Same thing, they told me they had no idea what I was talking about, I was even told there was no record of my mortgage loan. So I continued living in the property and had a renter in the other unit. Now the loan has been transferred to Bank of America and they have set a foreclosure sale date on my home for XXXX XXXX. I have tried to get to the bottom of this situation. They began sending me mortgage statements a few months ago, after 9 years of nothing. What is interesting is that the mortgage statement claims that the contractual remaining term on this loan is 29 years and 9 months. ( paperwork attached ) That means they are claiming I took out this loan in XXXX XXXX, when the title indicates I bought the home in XXXX. 

Something very fishy is going on here. I am trying to get to the bottom of it. I want to try and fix this problem and fix this loan but I ca n't even get a straight answer about what has happened with this loan, the failure to release the construction loan, why there were no statements issued etc. Of course any efforts to try and get Bank of America to allow me to apply for programs to SAVE my home are met with fierce resistance or indifference. I have never had the opportunity to apply for any type of programs that would allow me to be reviewed for retention options based on my current financial circumstances. I was never offered mediation as required in the state of New Jersey. I was never offered Occupied Conveyance. I was never allowed to be considered for any home saving programs and I do n't know why any of this happened. I really need some answers."

All that is fine except they NEVER send me the verification email and yes I have checked my Spam/Junk Email folder as well on multiple occasions for the last few days to no avail. 

On top of this ; try contacting Experian to either type, chat, or speak with an agent to resolve this matter!

I was told when I began with them to stop making any kind of payment to the creditors/accounts I listed with them, to begin depositing money ( a hefty amount at that! ) into a "" dedicated account '', and that after 90 days of missed payment they would begin negotiating a reduced balance and interest rate. In more than 5 months they have only negotiated ONE account. I now have several accounts about to be moved as "" charge offs ''. I have forwarded all communication with these creditors and asked repeatedly about why it had been more than 5 months and still no settlements, and many about to be charged off. their response each time was that I di not have enough in my dedicated account. I have researched what a charge off does to my credit ( they have never once told me a charge off would stay 7 years, and I have asked what it would do versus paying them monthly starting now ), and each of time Freedom has told me to let it go, and after the charge off they would negotiate. A charge off is too late and stays on my credit report for up to 7 years ( I have asked Freedom several times over the last 2 months about this )! I have one account that has already been charged off, and it was one of the smaller balances which they never tried to negotiate. I could have negotiated with all of my creditors based on the research and discussions I have now had with each of my creditors. All have stated once I agree to an amount and reduced interest rate directly with them, that the accounts would be reported as "" being paid '' which is by far better I am finding out than a "" charge off ''. Freedom has now put me in a position where I may never get my credit score back for multiple years, by stringing me along and skirting an real answers as to what this means to my credit, until the accounts reach the "" charge off '' stage, all while holding my {$630.00} a month plus {$25.00} and some change fees, in their account, but not actually negotiating or paying anything toward my accounts knowing they would/wee not going to negotiate until after all accounts were at this phase, which was NOT how this was explained nor ever said or explained to me thats what they were doing every time I asked and forwarded the information about what each creditor was doing.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"My mortgage was acquired by GreenTree/Ditech financial.nearly 3 years ago. Shortly after it was acquired they proceeded to modify terms of it even though I had gotten a letter that stated that nothing would be changed in terms of my 1999 loan. First the stopped applying excess funds to my loan balance and told me it was their policy to do it. Then they told me that they were going to start escrowing my account even though I have never had one to make it easier to resell and continue serving loan. This not only added escrow fees but gave them free loan of funds to use. I refused to agree and continued paying my taxes myself and paying mortgage. They stopped applying funds to my mortgage some time ago and placed them in escrow or somewhere else and withheld thousands from loan payment and run up late fees, extra interest and damaged credit to make it impossible to refinance loan. Talking to them about it is a waste of effort. I can documentment all payments sent to them in a timely manor. Concerned I could possibly loose house"

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. The INCORRECT Address that should be deleted are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX and there is XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX. Please keep in mind that Congress ( 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) ) makes it clear that I have a right to privacy. Privacy is not defined because only I can define what privacy is to me. ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. Under the subsection 15 usc 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) the reporting agency does not have my written instructions to report anything. The code says they need permissible purpose in accordance with written instructions. The credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, Experian, and XXXX ) do not have my written permission and this should be removed accordingly. I am under the impression that it seems as if a company has taken advantage of obtaining my personal address for their benefit. There is a huge risk of having the incorrect address on my consumer report because this could potentially be identity theft. I know that under the following law the CRA has to delete inaccurate information. 1681i. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy section ( 5 ) Treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information ( A ) In general If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer, an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall ( i ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation; and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer. Lastly, see the below where there must be maximum accuracy and unfortunately they are not practicing this law. 1681e. Compliance procedures Section ( b ) Accuracy of report Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates."

Debt collection,Other debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"About a week ago I checked my credit report and noticed a new account in collections. I immediately called the debt collection agency and found out the origin of this debt. The debt was several years old and had been on an automatic payment plan ( the original payment plan was set up through Affirm ) It was my understanding that the automatic payments continued until the full amount was paid off. The bank card that the payments out of was my at the time boyfriend 's, and we split up, so I did not know the payments had stopped. I never received any notice about this debt or I would have taken care of it immediately. 

As soon as I saw this on my credit report I called the company and paid the amount in full. My concern is that this will still have a negative impact on my credit score and I have been working very diligently on improving my score, so for a new collection to be added for a debt that I didn't know existed is very frustrating. 

Thank you for your time.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"My complaint is about TransUnion and a collection company pretending to be XXXX, the car manufacturer. Their legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and DBA XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX and others. They have a history of telephone # s right on the TU credit reports, where their New Jersey telephone # is in two addresses, one NJ and the other, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA. Some reports show an 800 # but most reports going way back have the NJ telephone #. I have disputed this fraudulent company to TransUnion ( TU ) approximately 50 times but TU has never provided any verifying information to me and they never actually investigate the disputes. The real XXXX XXXX XXXX, along with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) closed my account on XX/XX/XXXX. For the first few years the fake XXXX XXXX co reported the same and then they took the closed date off the my credit report for several months, making it look as though the account was still open. Since then they reported my account closed 2 more times on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX which kicks off late payments XXXX days each time they report it closed. I have the credit reports from TU going back to XXXX but TU doesnt have access to previous credit reports. TU says they do an investigation but they only give my dispute information to the collection agency to verify and of course they say yup its all correct everything is correct. Meanwhile, they dont even have a real XXXX account # or any other account # that I can use to get further information. I have been given XXXX validation that this liability is mine and that they have the legal right to collect it. 

I will be suing both TransUnion and this fraudulent collection company due the many damages I have incurred as a result of there fraudulent actions and TransUnions blatant disregard of the laws surrounding privacy and credit reporting. While my primary complaint is what Ive written so far, I must say that I am 100 % shocked by the fact that NO ONE is actually governing the credit reporting agencies at all! 
Further I am thinking about all of the taxes that I paid to the IRS and to the State of CT, from $ XXXX to $ XXXX per year in my prime and for a good 15-18 years of the same. My tax dollars fund the very same incompetent departments that are supposed to be protecting us from these things, when in fact, these agencies are completely useless. They literally do nothing except to refer consumers to articles on their website. 

I will upload as many documents as this system will allow me up to 10 or 12 docs : TU credit reports showing the collection co reporting different closed account dates ; the first bills I received from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and on the report dated XX/XX/XXXX it shows XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is not affiliated with the real XXXX, and a status of closed, which they reported closed the prior month XX/XX/XXXX. I also uploaded a snapshot from Toyota.com the car manufacturers. You will see that the name of the corporation is, XXXX XXXX XXXX and their subsidiary co that provides car loan and leases is call XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). I believe that TransUnion was given the complaint I made to another department which I made in error to the wrong dept so I thought. Anyway, I received 4 pages in one envelope containing 3 letter from TransUnion 1 or 2 days ago. I have attached them. They acknowledge my dispute and due to additional information they received they pushed their reply date out by 15 days. The next letter said that they received my cancellation of the dispute and they have closed it. The 3rd letter said something else I dont remember at this moment. I did not request that they cancel the dispute. I cant even get into my TU account because of technical problems ( as usual ) and when i could get into my account I wasnt able to upload any documents to them. The correct name and address of the fake XXXX XXXX XXXX  is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX Phone # : XXXX Thank you."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent me a letter stating that my Mortgage Loan APR, was automatically reducing to 8.4 % from 9.875 %, and it was locked for 5 years. Soon after, XXXX XXXX  XXXX took over XXXX, I told XXXX  XXXX XXXX about the automatic rate drop XXXX promised me for 5 years ( XXXX-XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX  XXXX wouldn`t honor it. 
I wrote XXXX XXXX XXXX Corporate Headquarters twice, they stated I was never mailed a letter like that from XXXX. I assured them that I did, and I wrote them again stating that I still have the original letter. They wouldn`t honor it a second time. 
Soon after, XXXXXXXX XXXX took over my Mortgage loan. Select Portfolio Servicing is the servicer of my loan. I have told them over and over repeatedly, that my balance is not correct because my balance should be less because my APR should be less for 5 years and I would be paying more balance and less interest over the 5 year term. They will not accept this part of my loan servicing either. I payed {$120000.00} for my home in XXXX and now in XXXX Select Portfolio and XXXXXXXX XXXX say that I owe just over {$220000.00}. and they are trying to foreclose on my property in the next few months. 
I recently read the CFPB bulletin, dated XXXX, page 4 to servicers about loan transfers and making sure they know about any modifications or trial offers made by previous servicer. And I wonder why nothing has ever been done on my loan. The following is pasted from the article ... ... 

During a number of examinations, CFPB examiners determined that servicers had failed to properly identify loans that were in a trial or permanent modification with the prior servicer at time of transfer. In other exams, CFPB examiners found that servicers had failed to honor trial or permanent modification offers unless they could independently confirm that the prior servicer properly offered a modification or that the offered modification met investor criteria. In some of these instances, CFPBs examination determined that the transferee servicers did not obtain all of the information they needed from the transferor servicer. As a result, the servicers required borrowers to submit additional paperwork or to provide copies of financial documents they had already submitted to the transferor servicer. These servicers also subjected some borrowers to substantial delays while reunderwriting their loans. In some cases, the borrowers subsequently received a new modification with inferior terms, and in others, the servicer actually conducted a foreclosure sale. In all of the cases discussed above, CFPB examiners concluded, based on the particular facts, that the servicers had engaged in unfair practices. 

The following from the same article was never done by either bank as well ... 

Error Resolution Procedures ( 12 CFR 1024.35 ) and Requests for Information ( 12 CFR 1024.36 ) Servicers are required to meet certain procedural requirements for responding to notices of error and written information requests.

If the transferee servicer receives a notice of error or information request from the borrower or the borrowers agent, the transferee servicer must comply with all applicable requirements under 12 CFR 1024.35 and .36 within the regulatory timeframes, even if the transferor was servicing the loan at the time of the alleged error or the event about which information is requested.

A transfer does not relieve transferor servicers from their obligations under 12 CFR 1024.35 and .36. Transferor servicers are obligated to respond to notices of error and information requests received from the borrower or borrowers agent up to one year after the loan was transferred or discharged.10 In closing, something has to be done about the amount my bank says I owe and furthermore I don`t see how they have the right to foreclose on my property when they don`t even know how much I really owe."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT : As of XX/XX/2020, we are writing to request a final correction of error to our creditor, XXXX, to correct and update our XXXX   Account on our Equifax Credit Report under Historical Account Information for : ( 1 )  XX/XX/2020 - Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and Report Scheduled Payment Amount of {$4300.00}, ( 2 ) XX/XX/2020 - Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and Report Scheduled Payment Amount of {$4300.00} and ( 3 ) XX/XX/2020 - Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and Report Scheduled Payment Amount of {$4300.00}. These items still need to be corrected and updated since it is still indicating a forbearance history on our Equifax credit report, which is entirely erroneous and inaccurate since our XXXX  Account was NEVER in forbearance and SHOULD NEVER have been put in forbearance status, but was due to Loancares erroneous system, which they have admitted automatically reported our account in forbearance on XX/XX/2020 IN ERROR, AFTER we cancelled our forbearance request on XX/XX/2020. Therefore, our XXXX Account was never in forbearance and should never have been reported in forbearance status to all the consumer credit agencies and XXXX is legally liable to make us whole with no forbearance history indicating on our Equifax credit report. 

FULL COMPLAINT IN DETAIL : CREDIT REPORTING ERROR : EQUIFAX Credit Report Our XXXX  Account In Historical Account Information : ( 1 ) XX/XX/2020 - Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and Report Scheduled Payment Amount of {$4300.00}, ( 2 ) XX/XX/2020 - Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and Report Scheduled Payment Amount of {$4300.00} and ( 3 ) XX/XX/2020 - Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and Report Scheduled Payment Amount of {$4300.00}. 
As of XX/XX/2020, our Equifax Credit Report is currently reporting our XXXX  Account under Historical Account Information as follows : ( 1 ) XX/XX/2020 - Comments Account In Forbearance and Scheduled Payment Amount not reported, ( XXXX ) XX/XX/2020 - Comments Account In Forbearance and Scheduled Payment Amount not reported, and ( 3 ) XX/XX/2020 - Comments Account In Forbearance and Scheduled Payment Amount not reported ( Please see attached Equifax Credit Reports for Borrower and Co-Borrower Dated XX/XX/2020 ). 
When speaking to our bank in order to obtain a new mortgage for an investment property, we were told that this shows prior forbearance history on our credit and would negatively impact our ability to obtain any new loan. By not removing all Comments Account In Forbearance in XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 and not reporting the Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 on our Historical Account Information for our Loancare Account, this prevents us from working with our bank or other lenders. 
On XX/XX/2020, we contacted Equifax directly to request our Loancare Account on our credit report be corrected and updated as follows : in Historical Account Information : ( 1 ) remove all Comments Account In Forbearance in XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 and ( 2 ) report all Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX as {$4300.00}, XXXX as {$4300.00} and XX/XX/2020 as {$4300.00} be entered and updated on our credit report, however, we were told that our creditor, XXXX, would need to update this information on our behalf since this is their Account. 
Therefore, we are demanding that XXXX  correct and update our XXXX  Account directly with Equifax as follows : In Historical Account Information : ( 1 ) XX/XX/2020 Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and report Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX as {$4300.00}, ( 2 ) XX/XX/2020 Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and report Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX as {$4300.00}, XXXX XXXX ) XX/XX/2020 Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and report Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX as {$4300.00}. 
As you are aware, by not removing Comments : Account In Forbearance in XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 and not reporting the Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 under Historical Account Information on our Equifax credit report, this is negatively impacting our credit history and credit scores, which is preventing us from working with any lenders on obtaining a business loan since it is reporting a forbearance history on our Loancare Account, which we have disputed entirely from the beginning due to your erroneous credit reporting. 
Again, our XXXX Account should never have been put in forbearance status and we are demanding that you clear all forbearance history off our Equifax credit report. 

EXPLANATION OF CORRECTION OF ERROR : Our XXXX  Account Was Erroneously Placed In Forbearance Status And Was Removed On XX/XX/2020. 
Our XXXX Account was never in forbearance and therefore, should never have been reported in forbearance status, but was due to your system error which your company have admitted it automatically placed our account in forbearance even after we cancelled the forbearance request on XX/XX/2020, which it should never have happened. Your system automatically reported on XX/XX/2020 IN ERROR to the credit reporting agencies, even AFTER our forbearance was cancelled, which your company has acknowledged this was a system error. 
On XX/XX/2020, your company recognized your system error had erroneously placed our Loancare Account in forbearance status and therefore, removed the forbearance off our Loancare Account and updated the four major consumer reporting agencies : Equifax, XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX ( Please see attached Letters from Loancare Dated XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 ). 
Therefore, our XXXX Account should never have been placed in forbearance nor have any indication of any forbearance history. We are demanding that you clear all forbearance history off our Equifax credit report. 


FINAL RESOLUTION : Loancare To Update Our EQUIFAX Credit Report by Correcting The Errors On Our Loancare Account In Historical Account Information For ( 1 ) XX/XX/2020, ( 2 ) XX/XX/2020 and ( 3 ) XX/XX/2020 : By Removing All Comments Account In Forbearance and Reporting All Scheduled Payment Amount For Each Month. 
We are demanding that you clear all forbearance history off our Equifax credit report. In order to do so, we are demanding a final resolution that your company correct and update our Equifax credit report regarding our Loancare Account under the Historical Account Information for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 as follows : ( 1 ) XX/XX/2020 Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and report Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX as {$4300.00}, ( 2 ) XX/XX/2020 Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and report Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX as {$4300.00}, ( 3 ) XX/XX/2020 Remove Comments Account In Forbearance and report Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX as {$4300.00}. 
See attached Equifax Credit Report : XXXX XXXX Account Information for Borrower & Co-Borrower Dated XX/XX/2020. 
Please provide us a letter stating the above, that our XXXX  Account has been corrected and updated with Equifax to report our Historical Account Information for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 that ( 1 ) all Comments Account In Forbearance has been removed and ( 2 ) all Scheduled Payment Amount for XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 has been reported. 

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS Please See Attached Documents : 1. Equifax Credit Report : XXXX XXXX Account Information for Borrower Dated XX/XX/2020 XXXX. Equifax Credit Report : XXXX XXXX Account Information for Co- Borrower XXXX XX/XX/2020 3. Letter from XXXX : Account Removed from Forbearance Dated XX/XX/2020 4.

For the last two years I have been disputing incorrect late payments on my credit report from all 3 credit agencies. They have continuously ignored the errors of late payment history to only update the accounts as paid and closed. Their own credit report shows the inaccuracies in payment history and supplier remarks. These accounts have been paid and closed since XXXX of XXXX. Most of them are more than 6 years old. The incorrect late payments have re-aged this account and caused severe damage to my credit file and score for over 4 years.

Here are just some of the errors being reported by all three bureaus : 1. Incorrect start date. 2. Incorrect last verified date. 3. Incorrect last payment date. 4. Incorrect closed date. 5. Incorrect account status. 6. Account number is not visible and complete. 7. The creditor name is abbreviated. 8. The supplier/creditor information is incorrect. 9. Late payment history is physically impossible. 10. Remarks shown of late payment information is impossible. These accounts need to be deleted from my credit file at once. 

I have attached copies of the most recent disputes I have sent to each agency, I have also attached their responses or lack thereof. Experian has continued to update comments with paid and closed while ignoring the late payment history errors. XXXX has completely ignored my dispute and has never responded to any dispute. XXXX has deleted all but one of the incorrect late payments and ironically left one showing 120 days late, with the month prior as showing current. I have attached screenshots of how they continue to report these accounts inconsistently and inaccurately. 

I would appreciate that this bureau actually enforces the FCRA in concern of this matter. The only resolution is deletion. I have spoken with the supplier on XX/XX/XXXX and they have assured me there are no late payments they are reporting to any reporting agency. Unfortunately since that phone conversation they are no longer servicing these accounts and havent since XX/XX/XXXX. Any response given by the agencies stating these accounts were verified in XX/XX/XXXX is a flat out lie."

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Unknown,"CFPB Please help me. Shellpoint says anything conflates and changes the rules with each response. I have written to XXXX XXXX, the president, and the vice president because this is so fundamentally unfair for Shellpoint to change its statements, change the rules after I make all the trial payments, overcharge me for the streamline modification ( which I paid ), claim to have returned the third payment without any meritorious reason, and not provide the calculations of payment options with different years of payments and/or interests rates based on my completed mortgage assistance application. 

Please investigate Shellpoint 's duplicity and changing reasons for not fulfilling my permanent modification. 

I am supposed to have one point of contact. Shellpoint tried to assign me to another representative to misrepresent the facts that I did not make the sum total of payments due during the trial modification. 

In XXXX, I presented to CFBP a completed Shellpoint application for assistance. Shellpoint has not addressed why it did not provide a modification according to the application that I submitted, which would have been more affordable because the number of years and interest rate could have been adjusted. 

Shellpoint has not addressed why I was supposed to pay the incorrect streamline amount of {$1000.00}, when the streamline amount of the trial modification should have been {$990.00}. Shellpoint has not explained deflecting in bad faith it used my paying the corrected {$990.00} statement that Shellpoint sent to me as ground for alleging that I did not complete the terms of the modification. 

The purpose of a trial modification is to see if the person can make the payments. I made the trial payments and the rule is that I should be given a permanent modification. If I do not make the payments, then Shellpoint has grounds to revoke my modification. But, I could get better or crowd fund to pay the difference. Shellpoint is using the fact that I pointed out they gave me a streamline modification of {$1000.00}, which was more than my income on the completed assistance application against me. But, at the end of the day, I paid the correct trial payments. If I did not, then Shellpoint is at fault for sending a different amount and for being a nonresponse service provided for 60 days when I asked for clarification. 

Now, that I made all the trial payments. Shellpoint needs to do the calculation based on interest rates and adjusted years to bring the payment into something more affordable since Shellpoint is making as an argument that I said the {$1000.00} was not affordable instead of following the law that I made the trial payments, so I am supposed to be given a permanent modification. 

Shellpoint has not stated how it plans to rectify it claim to have sent back my third trial payment for no valid reason. I paid the statements sent to me. {$990.00} was the correct streamlined amount. But, because Shellpoint is not being transparent, I do not know how the mortgage payments could be lowered if they adjust the interest rate and years of payments based on my completed assistance application. 

Shellpoint has not answered why it should take no accountability for sending different statements and why it is not trying to fix 1 ) sending me conflicting statements 2 ) claiming to have sent my final trial payment back on a minor technicality that Shellpoint created ; and 3 ) claiming to have sent my third trial payment back when the {$990.00} was the correct Streamline amount and {$1000.00} was incorrect"

The total amount between taxes and insurance is roughly {$2500.00} which is already incorporated into my current payment now Mr cooper says I now owe {$3100.00} to {$3200.00} yearly and when questioned about the amount  they tried to confuse me which I had my accountant listening to the conversation and he noticed that they were trying to make things up as they went and when questions about the amount nothing added up properly. I also found out that Nationstar had been sued 3 time in 6 months for not divulging critical information and collecting funds it shouldnt be. I have a link to a website that you can look into yourself and you can be the judge of whats going on but it seems Nationstar AKA Mr Cooper is back with the fraud ring they just got sued for but I suspect Im the newest victim to their game they play.

My workers compensation lawyer, XXXX XXXX XXXX has sent XXXX XXXX a letter explaining my financial situation and my income. I have lost my vehicle, home furnishings and anything I had of value to try to pay my mortgage. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I made a payment of {$810.00} to a Representative named XXXX my confirmation number was XXXX. I have been watching my checking account daily for this to come out of my account as I live day to day and keep a very close eye on every penny. Today I called and spoke with XXXX and asked about the payment I made on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, she said that it had been deleted. Much to my surprise I asked why and she could not give me an answer. I asked if I could please make that payment again and to please note my account that I had made the payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
I suspect that the payment was deleted because when I first tried to make the payment on XXXX, I spoke with XXXX and he would not accept my payment because it was only a XXXX month payment and he said that per their policy he needed me to pay two months. I told him that I couldnt pay two months as I cant forsee if I will have {$810.00} by the end of the month. I tried explaining to him numerous times that I am due a settlement here very soon and plan on bringing the account up to date. I asked to speak with a supervisor and while on hold I hung up and decided to call back and speak with someone else. When I called back and spoke with XXXX she immediately took my payment without a problem. 

This company calls me at least XXXX times a day. I block the number and they call from a different number. They send people to my house taking pictures and leave notices on my door. I have confirmed that I still live in this house and to not come back on the property and not to be taking pictures, however, they still do it on a monthly basis. Just a few days ago the man who came out here was armed with a weapon on his hip. I told him not to come back on my property. We have received up to XXXX letters a day from them. It 's ridiculous. 
I am paying Selene a payment every month, they will not take partial payments, or anything. I have explained over and over my situation. I dont like being behind on payments, and I have only 2-3 more weeks to go and everything will be fine again. I just want them to take my payments and stop harassing me. Besides a letter from my lawyer and me telling them what has happen to me I dont know what else to do.

Also I relocated in XXXX of 2020, and I updated my current address at that time and Ive never received any correspondence of any type until XXXX, after I sent a few emails to total loss trying to get answers and I put all information that i assumed was needed in the email in hopes that things would her done & there would be no excuses. Still no response to emails or no contact to discuss the issue with the returned checks or emails I had sent regarding the delinquent amount on my credit report. Ive never spoken with BBVA total loss department, only collection who had no knowledge of anything that was going on.. I have call and sent emails. In XXXX was when i received a credit alert saying that {$3600.00} was 30 days pass due as of XX/XX/XXXX. I dont know what this amount is and Ive contact BBVA loan department and no one is able to explain and suggest transferring me to Total loss who never answers. Just recently Ive received a notice in the mail and Im still puzzled because theres been a third check reissued in attempt to pay out the loan and the delinquent notice i received this month doesnt match what is on the credit report. This is a lot to type m, all Im asking is that this mess get cleared up, payments applied like they should have been months ago and my credit is cleared up with this outrageous delinquent amount. I do not understand how all this can happen with zero communication. Im finding out that checks arent being applied because i call and the automated system give me the full loan balance, less the gap payment that was also under paid because of BBVA giving wrong information. I was not aware of a {$3600.00} delinquent payment that has be placed on my credit i have no clue what that amount could possible be and no one has called or sent any notice about it. BBVA has failed at handling this total loss.. they have been issued a total of 3 checks not 1 but 3, 3 different times, in the same amounts and they cant seem to apply anyone of them to pay this loan off. I have never had a delinquent payment over the coarse of the loan never! Ive paid the loan even during hard times.. Durning my layoff due to Covid I had 4 deferred payments and that has been paid. I was never delinquent."

We disputed it through her credit card and they charged it back to the fitness center. The next month they tried to bill her again. We cancelled the card and it was charged back to them again. Almost 1 year later they decide to send me a bill in the mail. I sent them all the proof that the membership had been cancelled and advised them that I never signed anything or authorized them to bill me in anyway. They advised me they would take care of it. They referred it to a collection agency.

The initial start date of the Medicaid was incorrect which later caused some issues between my previous insurance and Medicaid as to who was going to cover the hospital expenses. This took over a year to correct with medicaid finally being backdated to reflect the correct start date of coverage. All medical companies that were affected, and still waiting for insurance to cover the bills, were notified to resubmit to Medicaid. Some companies grew impatient and submitted claims to debt collectors which in turn filed claims against my credit rating. Additionally, debt collector - Merchants Credit Guide - began harassing phone calls several times a day concerning a {$300.00} dollar debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Kentucky which is part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It got to the point where I didnt answer the calls and turned off my voicemail. Both the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were made aware of my situation by both myself and the XXXX Kentucky Health Department, yet XXXX XXXX forwarded my dept to a collection agency.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Was not notified of investigation status or results,"Experian : Please refer to your data as to this issdue here : Prepared for : XXXX XXXX XXXX Personal & Confidential Date Generated XX/XX/XXXX Report Number XXXX The report of my own here is a diplomatic attempt to address what has become for me and others a long standing and unfortunately universally accepted source of now in-accurate data and thus universally accepted credit information and by posting this in a more conspicuous place am formally requesting you revisit the issue of account classification and do a review of how one 's financial stability can suffer merely by unaware of its peculiar nature take out a Home Equity loan that is, a bit over one year later affecting my FICO score negatively in such a negative fashion that it's roller coaster up and down motion makes one dizzy and XXXX deserves this second look to see if a more finely crafted denominator and classification for this loan product might prove both useful to you as you hone in on it and garner the appreciation of your clients who are similarly mystified at the current state of affairs and then might be more helpful to those such as myself that at no fault of their own is no longer distressed as to it's effect on one 's good name, overall outlook on live and planning for everything from a vacation to a solid retirement and thus face the somewhat one 's debts on time, resulting in a credit profile befitting the borrowers that diligently repay their financial obligations in full and on time. 


The result of over a year 's worth of education and research on my part leaves me with few answers and many frustrated efforts lately in fact at even securing a conventional mortgage now to pay this loan off and be done with it, as my FICO score has been so depreciated it's become unfeasible I feel that as the industry leader it would seem worth Experian 's time to look again at your loan typing of the HELOC and LOAN and perhaps recategorize how each have become segmented in the past to represent the types of credit accounts an individual may have ... and how these standards in for instance your Score 8 calculations create a distinct disadvantage for those that also temporarily have higher than is healthy utilization of such unsecured debt and other measures ( the other bureau 's reporting scores for myself are not so seriously skewed ) that may indeed lead to a more accurate delineation between a real property loan which is just as or more secure at the grass roots user level and in instances such as my own, cease to create undue financial hardship and the resulting expense and lack of flexibility that ensues when indeed that very flexibility was why the loan appealed to me in the first place. 

I do understand and appreciate EXPERIAN and it's genuine and everlasting quest for accuracy on all data points and yet, subsequent to your recent evaluation of my own credit worthiness.. such classification is sorely out of whack with reality and causes me to think how nice it would be to actually become so inattentive to financial matters, be late on payments six months of the year if not seven once and awhile and frankly stop caring or give a hoot for what my financial future might become ... For I am NOT my FICO score , right ...? I'm the guy that has to earn, borrow any additional funds necessary in this credit intensive day and age and repay all, on schedule with the interest ... 

I was unaware of the classification this loan would fall under, thinking ( correctly ) that it's even more of a secure bet as it's funding paid to pay off any debt accumulated and the majority went to improve the asset in the form of a remodeled my kitchen and bathroom in my home and thus increased the solidity of the collateral and the note securing the loan, yet discovering that in all but specific name my HELOC is reporting as an unsecured credit card and that the words 'secured by ' appear nowhere on my EXPERIAN consumer report anyway which in my case has become a grossly unbalanced way of looking at the remodel itself as if it didn't happen at all and I took my family on a world cruise instead. 

Hopefully if you are still listening I plan to herein provide the basic facts for you and let 's see if you might be able to assist in getting my score back to where it belongs ... and if so i'll keep the HELOC or at least be able to get credit at the DEPOT for carpeting for heaven 's sake. I shall also briefly lay out below what might happen to one 's financial stability if taking advantage of the equity in y home built up over many years and a loan on paper anyway that is indistinguishable for the most part from said Credit XXXX and usually as the numbers do matter, with a limit that might better befit a sports hero on a spending streak and for the most part has a limit far in excess of the average individual 's card in his wallet. 
-- -- - I at first thought it was my lender incorrectly reporting the loan and it's particulars but then discovered it was not after disputing this issue here, Seeking further clarification, I have spoken with more than a few lenders about this recently, for my better sense says to pay this 30 year loan off as soon as possible ... .but the fact that it's reporting has driven my FICO score into the ground I can not now qualify for a reasonable mortgage to pay if off and it's taken four to five months to discover this, while at the same time presently I am forking out 1/2 of my SSA benefits to cover just interest on the personal loans and credit card i used to complete the remodel, given that 1/3 of the funds were redirected by the lender to other unrelated debt early repayment, which at the time did not worry me but even I ( with a XXXX XXXX XXXX ) can't keep every XXXX  job in budget, least of all on my own home! 

I took out a $ XXXX Home Equity line of credit against my home in XX/XX/XXXX which is the only loan I have against the property which is now  worth {$170000.00}. I spent the majority of the funds over last summer remodeling the kitchen and bath and upgrading the electrical and plumbing systems to this 100 year old home. My credit score had been XXXX or so until I joined the Credit Union three years ago but the credit reporting practices of this lender are not so clear cut I have discovered and as recently happened changes in reporting are not announced in advance or for that matter told to us at all ... .Suffice it to say that this organization feels entitled to change and update everything while it ignores the status quo to such a degree that even they can not offer an explanation but have refused to offer the loan I seek on reasonable terms and believe it or not I have been encountering difficulty qualifying even with those that failed to advise me of the financial consequences stating "" your FICO score will improve in a few months '' when indeed it's been the opposite direction ... so much for faith in lending, eh?

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Personal information incorrect,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to dispute several inaccuracies on my credit report that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), and Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ). These inaccuracies have caused significant financial harm to me, as well as unnecessary emotional distress. 

Firstly, my correct name is XXXX XXXX, but the credit bureaus are reporting it as XXXX XXXX. This violates Section 1681e ( b ) of the FCRA, which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of consumer reports. 

Secondly, the credit bureaus are reporting multiple inaccurate addresses that do not reflect my current address, including XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX ( XX/XX/2022 ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX ( XX/XX/2022 ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX This violates Section 1681e ( b ) of the FCRA, which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of consumer reports, and Section 1681g, which requires credit reporting agencies to disclose all addresses that have been reported by furnishers of information within the past two years, but they must also identify the current address of the consumer based on information that is available to them. 

Furthermore, the credit bureaus are reporting incorrect employment information, listing my employer as XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. This violates Section 1681e ( b ) of the FCRA, which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of consumer reports. 

These inaccuracies have caused significant financial harm to me, as well as emotional distress. They have led to me being denied credit and higher interest rates, making it difficult to secure a loan for a new car, rent an apartment, and obtain credit cards with reasonable terms. 

Therefore, I request that the creditor remove these unverified accounts from my credit report and take appropriate actions to ensure that my credit report is accurate. I also request that you enforce the laws that have been violated, including the FCRA, FACTA, and ECOA, to prevent this from happening to me or anyone else in the future. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

Issue 2. I paid the requested mortgage sum amount as personally directed by TD Bank upon completing 18 months of forbearance and it sat in the TD mortgage account, labeled by TD Bank as "" unassigned funds '', which prompted late fees charged to me and an additional error on my credit report for late payment. 

TD Bank has since reviewed my payment history and removed all "" late fees '', but they have not updated my credit report and my co-borrower 's / husband 's credit report. When I called TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX about these 2 credit report mistakes, they told me to write to the credit report agencies.

It doesn't make sense that they would expect us to have all three payments available since the whole purpose behind this program was to compensate for the fact that we weren't able to work while our area recovered.

We've talked to Mr. Cooper several times and they're refusing to work with us outside of forcing us to refinance. They've accepted several payments from us, but they're still forcing the issue. We don't think this is just or in the spirit of the law. It sounds like a scheme to try to take our house."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Credit monitoring or identity theft protection services,Problem with product or service terms changing,"After the Equifax data breach, I did what Equifax recommended I do : I put a freeze on all of my accounts with them, XXXX XXXX and Experian. 

Apparently, as part of the settlement with Equipfax they were ordered to offer free credit monitoring services to consumers for 3 years or a {$120.00} stipend to anyone to start these services for a 3 year period at their cost. Information was emailed out to consumers telling them pick one or the other.. I completed Equifax 's submission for the {$120.00} stipend and sent it back to Equifax, As far as I can tell, this settlement was a ploy to get consumers to subscribe to credit monitoring services and an admission that Equifax can't guarantee protection of my data that I didn't give to them in the first place and didn't give them permission to have and accumulate.. 

With my accounts frozen, I don't need credit monitoring services. Now Equifax is arguing that I didn't meet any criteria for receiving this {$120.00} stipend after following their initial advice to simply freeze my credit. 

Are they now saying then even with a freeze on my credit file that they can not protect my data.? It coast me a fair amount of time and personal record management to manage pin numbers and website to place these freezes on my accounts and moving forward every time I need to open it, I need to spend time to manage that process. 

SO in the end unless I agree to get credit monitoring services from the same company that couldn't protect my data in the first the idea of "" damages to me the consumer '' does not apply.. 

I believe I am entitled to take that {$120.00} and use it as I see fit."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"My husband and I had our identities stolen. In the course of dealing with this my husband was temporarily laid off from his job and I am XXXX. This was all taking place from approximately XXXX through XXXX. We had over {$7000.00} stolen from our checking account. I contacted FNB where I was referred to XXXX as she was the representative dealing with our mortgage. I explained the situation we were in to her and told her I would do my best to get caught up over the next few months. She recommended that I fill out there mortgage assistance package to give us time and/or assistance which I did and we were ultimately denied assistance. I was making payments on the account and assumed they were still working with me since when I spoke to an agent in XXXX and he checked with XXXX who was to busy to get on the line with me, he said that as long as I kept making payments she wouldn't proceed with a forclosure. Then on XX/XX/XXXX the Shefiff came to our home to issue us a notice that our home was up for sheriff sale on XX/XX/2023 I immediately called FNB mortgage services and spoke to XXXX who said that XXXX was supposed to stop the paperwork from going to the attorney, but didn't. He said he would get a message to her but that I could disreguard the notice as long as I continued to make payments everything would be fine. He also said that a call would be made to the attorney to let them know that I was making the agreed payments. My husband had to have XXXX  XXXX in XXXX. We were able to make a hardship withdraw from his annuity so we decided to take enough to just pay off the mortgage. I called to get a payoff on the mortgage and after several agents and almost a week of waiting I spoke to XXXX who said XXXX was off on medical leave so he was working on our case. He sent me a payoff quote that included legal, collection and late fees totaling {$4000.00}. I think this is completely unfair since I was told that as long as I was working with them everything would be fine and now that we're paying the loan off there are suddenly all these fees?? I did go to a branch where I had to wait for almost 30 minutes till the teller could get the mortgage service department to lift a restriction on the account so I could make the payment. I paid {$85000.00} directly on to the principle to avoid futher interest till I could contact someone for assistance. I got a call the following morning from XXXX who told me that I could not put the whole amount on the principle. I told her that I could put whatever I wanted on the principle and she replied that they wouldn't release the deed until all the legal fees were paid. I said that was fine because I didn't expect that they would. She the asked where I got the money to pay off the mortgage and if I sold the home. I didn't feel like this was an appropriate question to ask so I just told her we didn't sell the home. She said she would have to talk to her supervisor about putting the whole amount I paid on the principle and since then I haven't gotten a response."

I was notified the day the rate lock expired, XX/XX/XXXX, that the title company was unable to secure records showing a secure and clear lien on my home and that supposedly the title company could not provide an estimated time to secure these records so Chase Mortgage decided to let the rate expire. My wife within 2 hours of searching the internet found all the required documentation in the local county 's office website and on a federal website and she has no formal training or background on how to perform these type title searches so surely a title company and Chase should have been able to find it in 90 days. Additionally, there is provision in the law that allows the current lien holder, Chase Mortgage, to execute an affidavit to secure the lien which takes less than 30 days and Chase Mortgage chose not to perform this task as well thereby choosing to allow the loan rate to expire. Additionally, Chase Mortgage was the current holder or the lien and had secured a previous title policy securing the lien in XX/XX/XXXX so Chase knew the records existed and should have had clear record of this information since they were the current lien holder. Now, Chase mortgage is refusing to honor the original refinance rate, refusing to reimburse my earnest money, refusing to reimburse my appraisal fees, and not returning my calls or emails.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Greetings, I am writing to lodge a formal complaint against Right Path Servicing regarding their handling of my mortgage escrow account. This issue concerns a significant change in my homeowner 's insurance and the subsequent lack of response and action from Right Path Servicing to adjust my escrow account accordingly. 

Initial Change Notification ( XX/XX/2023 ) : I informed Right Path Servicing of a change in my homeowner 's insurance provider, switching from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The new annual premium was substantially lower, {$1200.00} compared to the previous {$3400.00}. This change should have led to an adjustment in my monthly mortgage payment due to the reduced escrow requirement. 

Lack of Response and Action : Despite sending multiple emails ( the first on XX/XX/2023, followed by two subsequent follow-ups ), I received no acknowledgment or response from Right Path Servicing . My emails detailed the policy change and requested an updated escrow analysis. Additionally, attempts to contact the company via the provided telephone number were unsuccessful, with the phone system appearing to be designed to avoid direct customer interaction. 

Financial Implications : The failure of Right Path Servicing to respond and adjust my escrow account in light of the reduced insurance premium has placed me in a difficult financial position. As a customer, I am unable to afford the new payment amount and the delay in adjustment is causing financial strain.

Actions Taken : To resolve this issue, I have sent three detailed emails to Right Path Servicing, each outlining the situation and requesting an urgent escrow analysis update. I have also attempted to contact them through their customer service phone line, with no success in reaching a live representative. 

This situation reflects a lack of customer service and a disregard for the financial implications on a customer due to the company 's inaction. I seek the assistance of the CFPB in resolving this matter and ensuring that Right Path Servicing conducts the necessary escrow account adjustment in a timely manner, as per the change in the homeowner 's insurance policy. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, Concerned Customer"

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"After falling behind {$2800.00} on my mortgage I reached out to Huntington for help getting the account current in XX/XX/XXXX. I was told if I made three consecutive payments on time that the past due balance who would be deferred to the end of the loan and my account would be made current. I made those consecutive payments in XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. If not all at least part of the monthly payments were made via check through my account with another credit union the remaining portion was transfer out of my Huntington checking account to the mortgage account. Sometimes I paid it in cash but always at local branches. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Huntington Bank sent me a letter stating that I had successfully completed the deferment program and the past due balance of {$2800.00} was going to be deferred to the end of my loan as well as letting me know that my account was now current. The letter also stated that my next payment was n't going to be due till XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to receiving this letter it was brought to my attention that my payment for XX/XX/XXXX had not cleared so I resubmitted the payment via cash at a local Huntington branch. 

On XX/XX/XXXX i received another letter from Huntington stating that my home was now in foreclosure and my account was being referred to a lawyer. The letter also stated that if I wanted any help saving my home then to reach out to their Home Savers Department which I did. At that time I requested to start the process for saving my home as well as ask questions as to why my home was being placed in foreclosure status. At that time I was told that they can not answer any questions and that I had to contact the law firm that was given. Once contacting the firm they told me they did not have such information and after several calls between Huntington and myself and myself and the law firm I decided to ask the lawyers for a Redemption amount. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Huntington sent me another letter along with a check for the payment amount of my mortgage. 
Last week I received the Redemption letter I requested from the lawyer. To my surprise the letter stated that I was a total of 7 months behind on my mortgage. The two months that was supposed to be deferred to the end of the loan ( {$2800.00} ) along with 5 additional months ( {$7100.00} ). Totalling in {$11000.00} including fees. 

Once reading this I went to the local branch and spoke with the branch manager named XXXX. We went over the paperwork and she made some phone calls and told me that she would get back with me for the branch was soon to close. At that time I also asked for itemized printout of the payments made for my mortgage account. The next day she called me and told me that she was able to speak to someone and they express that I needed to get some missing documents for the homesavers program back to them. When I asked her about the print out of my account and was told that the person she spoke with said that they did n't have that for me. 

With that being said my question is where is the money that I have paid. My Huntington checking account does n't reflect the transferred funds but the check through cleared with the credit union. I do not understand how I can receive one letter stating that I was only behind {$2800.00} and now it 's a sum of {$7100.00}. Where did my payments go and why are they being held against me.? No one from the bank will speak to me nor give me the documents that I requested. And when I speak with the lawyers they do not have the information that I 'm seeking. It 's my fear that I will have to pay them twice for the same month and or loose my home."

They electronically withdraw their payment each month from my XXXX bank account on or around the XXXX of each month. XXXX is reporting 60, 90, 120 day lates on my credit report for months they have collected their payment.

Here are those late dates : 90 day late for XXXX, 120 day late for XXXX, 120 day late for XXXX. I have tried calling numerous times and I have been unsuccessful in resolving this urgent issue. I have disputed these late payments with the credit bureaus and each time XXXX responds with no changes made. I have sent written request via registered mail to XXXX asking for this payment history to be corrected, and again they have not responded. I have emailed their complaint department and again, no response from XXXX. I have depleted all of my options and I am very frustrated. XXXX is hurting my credit and scores tremendously when they are collecting their timely payment each time. How can I possibly be late when they collect their money each month? I have proof of payment by providing a Bank statement for each month they claim the payment is late."
Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"The company did address the fact that I have a loan modification in place that they have not been horning, they promised to send me copies or proof of my payments being return with a detailed accounting of the payments not a payment history which shows I have made payments in for XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX yet I can not report any mortgage interest for tax year of XX/XX/XXXX as it states I have not made payments yet the history clearly shows I have. However, I do not have the return payments that are in question. I would like to know why we have so much of conflict with my payment history when I am not 670 days past due as the payment history shows it. My payments per month per the loan medication issued in XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX  is for {$1300.00} I have been making payments for XXXX. In summary I am very disappointed in the level of service and communication regarding my account with Ditech, I have called numerous times and have not gotten a call back, I have sent in the loan mod paperwork and have been approved for a loan mod that your company will not honor and did not have record of until I sent it but yet do not acknowledge it..

In Summary, This is a wrongful foreclosure process and proceedings, and I am disputing being 680 plus days in default.. It is not my fault the company DITECH did not know I have a loan mod that was approved by XXXX/Green tree. I am also disputing the said re instatement balance owed based on the fact that you have not proven where my payments are that have been sent for the last Year and half, and have not updated my mortgage balance with the correct amount owed as you did not have record of my current loan mod which is in question. Please stop this wrongful foreclosure and place my loan back into a payment status with the correct bal. please your co operation is appreciated."

Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I attempted to cancel my XXXX service at the end of XX/XX/XXXX due to service not working for nearly a month ( part XXXX-XXXX ). We ignored it initially because we used XXXX to stream most of what we consumed. Not wanting to pay for something we werent using, I called to cancel our service. They asked if Id consider allowing them to fix it at no cost. ( Actually charging us but giving a credit to my account to cover the charge ). The technician came out to my home a total of three time in XX/XX/XXXX. After the service failed again, I called to cancel the service in mid XXXX. At that time, we were told that wed receive a box to send back our equipment. The box never arrived. I called back Again in XXXX. I began to try to make records of my conversations at that point because I received different information each time I called. It also appeared they were trying not to cancel my service as was being requested. This was more evident by the bill I received showing my service was not cancelled. They charge me for XXXX and XXXX. Here are a few records of my interactions over the next several months. I didnt get information for all of my interactions with them but here are a few : XXXX cancellation XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Cancellation number:XXXX Credit will be back to original cancellation date. 


XXXX XXXX XXXX Cancellation number : Disconnection SR # : XXXX An escalation will be put in and someone will contact me about the fixing the matter of the additional charges. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX est said they could not talk about this charge and refused to escalate the matter. She also stated XXXX XXXX XXXX could no longer discuss the charges with me. I could only speak to the collection agency theyd sent me to. 


I was finally able to learn that I could take the equipment to a XXXX store and return it and I did that. 

One fact to prove I cancelled the service in XXXX was that I signed up for XXXX now streaming service since we were already streaming other services like XXXX. I still currently have XXXX XXXX. We plan to cancel because of this issue but will keep It until we hear back for the FTC. Its further evidence that we cancelled the regular XXXX service. ( As no one would keep a regular and streaming services of XXXX. ). 

The original outstanding charge was for roughly {$120.00}. Its not inflated to {$190.00} with their penalties and interest. I do not owe XXXX XXXX XXXX anything. In truth, I should have been compensated for no/intermittent service part of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and part of XX/XX/XXXX up to my cancellation date. Not only was I not compensated but a collection agency is contacting two of my uncles, my wife and brother in law asking for personal information about me. I do not feel I should be taken to collections over a debt I do not owe. I want this constant harassment to stop and Id like to file a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX for the way they've tried extort money from a consumer by not canceling my service as requested. If they record the calls as they say, all my assertions are easily verifiable. Your agency is the only protection regular Americans have against these large companies ability to attack and harm our credit. I thank you in advance for your attention and help. Im also willing to appear in court or before Congress if necessary. I just dont want these people to do this kind of stuff and get away with it.

I've talked to the bank & they've agreed to update the accounts.

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Settlement process and costs,Unknown,"Good evening, My name is XXXX XXXX and my mortgage is with Nationstar Mortgage. My home flooded in XXXX of XXXX. Your company 's Loss Drafts Dept. has been very difficult to deal with and I have consulted with an attorney to file a lawsuit for my remaining funds as well as pain and suffering due to the financial strain of being displaced and the extreme difficulty I 've had with your company. I was given money from XXXX for my contents coverage in which I used to start the rebuilding process of my home to move everything along so my family and I could return home. I was told to send all paid receipts for reimbursement and I did so. It took a month or so before I was reimbursed, but I was reimbursed and I used those funds to continue putting work into my home. I have increased the value of my home. Being that I increased the value of my home, the loss draft department is stating that they have overpaid me and the receipts I submitted does not add up to what was reimbursed which they should. Someone is not adding properly because before now everything was adding up. 

I had a XXXX inspection about a week and half from the date of the email in which the results stated that I needed to repair the garage, purchase closet doors for XXXX bedroom, and purchase appliances. I spoke with at least XXXX representatives as well as XXXX or XXXX supervisors explaining to them that I did not have the funds to purchase those items to finish the structural repairs. I was then told to submit invoices for the cost of the above list and they will send the funds for me to make the purchases. I borrowed the money from a family member and made the purchases to complete the repairs and submitted the receipts. The first XXXX representatives told me the reimbursement was denied because I 've been overpaid. I asked how would they send me funds to purchase the items if they are denying the reimbursement that I am requesting to pay my family member back of {$3000.00}? After speaking with multiple representatives, I was then transferred to a manager by the name of XXXX XXXX whom then told me that they would have made the check out to the store ( XXXX XXXX ) I was making the purchases from and myself to purchase what I needed which makes no sense if I had to go to multiple stores due to materials being out of stock. What if I had to go to XXXX? Who gives an invoice for sheetrock, sheetrock mud, paint, etc. That does n't make any sense. Some receipts I did not submit from having to purchase additional materials once the job started and more materials were needed because they continue to deny the request, but still asking for the receipts. I also had my garage door installed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I was told to submit an invoice signed by the person installing the garage door with the companies ' letterhead when I spoke with the representative on last week. Today, XXXX tells me that he ca n't accept that invoice because my signature was n't on it and no XXXX for the company. Why is that needed for a garage door? This information was not told to me by the last representative and this is the most frustrating part. The employees for this company are not knowledgeable at all. They give misleading and incorrect information and this has been a problem throughout the entire process. I 've been told that receipts I submitted for the month of XXXX were not approved because it was prior to the date of the claim in XXXX which shows they do n't know the months of the year. I 've had to go through receipts and add everything with representatives on the phone for hours because they ca n't seem to do simple math and this is utterly ridiculous. 

I 'm at the point now of continuing the process with my attorney to file a lawsuit with XXXX"

My personal issue, apart from obvious insider trading violations on their part, is the website they set up to see if individuals ' information was compromised.

Debt collection,Credit card,Communication tactics,Threatened to take legal action,"When my debt was transferred to Nelson & Kennard, I believe I paid XXXX payments during the transfer period. I requested in writing and verbally ( to my point of contact 's administrative assistant ) to be issued a statement. I did not know how much I owed and which payments had been accounted for. After five months of payments, still no communications of any kind ( letters, phone calls or e-mail ). A bit odd, I thought. I sent a letter and stated that I would no longer pay this debt if I did not see some sort of recognition of my payments. Nothing. I made payments ( {$700.00} / month ) for an additional year. Still nothing. After numerous calls and letters I could not reach any one that would speak to me, left lots of messages, but no responses. So, after eighteen months I did stop paying. 

Fifteen months later, still no communication of any sort EXCEPT a summons to court ( received three days ago ). In the summons they state that they repeatedly tried to contact me by phone and mail. This is a lie. No statements, no communications of any sort. 
What do I wish to do? I am happy to resume paying this debt but I want the communications to be monitored in some way so that Nelson & Kennard will have to give the statements due me under the law. Indeed, after eighteen months of payments without any communications, something was indeed broken."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"On XX/XX/19 I placed a phone call to Key Bank customer contact center to inquire on the best way for my parents to make an extra payment to the principal only of my mortgage. I was advised to simply mail a check and make a notation to apply to the principal only. No further instructions or steps were advised. On XX/XX/19 a check for {$15000.00} was mailed to Key Bank 's mortgage payment center to be applied to my existing mortgage. A memo was written on the check specifying "" extra principal only payment ''. Concerned that an individual processing the check may show a lack of attention to detail, a letter was also enclosed with the check. The letter explicitly outlined that the full amount was to be applied to the principal of the loan only. This directive was even typed in bold print. The letter also referenced the involved loan number and the most recent statement was enclosed to ensure it was applied correctly. Finally, both my phone number as well as the payee 's were provided in the letter should there be any questions. 

Upon receiving the subsequent mortgage statement in the mail, I was frustrated to discover the overly detailed and redundant instructions were not followed. The {$15000.00} payment was broken down as follows : {$10000.00} - Principal {$280.00} -- -- -- Interest {$270.00} -- -- -- Escrow {$4200.00} -- - Partial Payment ( unapplied ) On XX/XX/19 I called Key Bank customer service and spoke with XXXX ( employee XXXX ). I explained to XXXX that there has been a severe mishandling of a major payment. Unfortunately, I recall her initial response to be wow as opposed to sorry. After a 43 minute phone call, including multiple holds she advised me the issue would be corrected. XXXX provided an explanation for the mishap, stating that any payments received after a statement has been generated will automatically be applied to interest and escrow corresponding to the next months schedule. She further advised me if I want to make extra principal payments in the future, Im required to submit the payment in between a regularly scheduled payment and the time in which a statement is generated. Its needless to say, the process of making extra principal payments is about as clear as mud. As XXXX was giving me this explanation it was clear she was working for the bank, not the customer. Its simply unfair to expect customers to bear the burden of getting the issue corrected. XXXX also failed to explain what the partial payment was and why it was unapplied. 

I wholeheartedly believe the root cause of this issue isnt a simple process flaw - but an ethics flaw. The employee who processed the payment clearly acted unethically. After speaking with XXXX it also seems clear Key Bank leadership is also culpable for allowing such a mismanaged process to exist. Is this process by design to collect more interest on loans? It is with much regret this incident has made me lose faith in Key Bank. Its sad that customers are all but obligated to vigilantly double check transactions to ensure we are not taken advantage of."

Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"I received notice that my credit score had dropped due to a collection account in XX/XX/XXXX. I logged into XXXX  and found a collections account for XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$5800.00}. I originally thought this debt was not mine and submitted a complaint that I did not owe this. XXXX  agreed with me and removed the debt from my report. 

In XX/XX/XXXX it popped up again with an new collection company Enhanced Recovery Co. I disputed this again. Except this time they sided with the collection agency and said I owed it. I did some research and found it was a collection from XXXX for an unpaid bill. This was news to me because my XXXX bill was paid in full monthly and I never missed a payment. 

I found that the account in question was a closed account with XXXX when I updated my last phone. XXXX started a new account and closed the previous one out. 

In XX/XX/XXXX someone had ordered 4 XXXX XXXX, a XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a XXXX watch under the old account number associated with me. I never received a bill or notice this had happened until it went to collections. Now I have been fighting to get it removed my credit report. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX to have the debt disputed. They agreed over the phone this is not my debt and my current account is in good standing. I submitted a fraud dispute on their online dispute center and never heard back. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX  to question the last result to not remove the debt. They filled a fraud dispute and told me to file a complaint with the FTC. 

I have attached the bill of the account that was fraudulently used to purchase the equipment in my name."

Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I agreed to a month trial of the services provided by XXXX for nutrition. They increased the price I paid since I was not agreeing to sign up for the full 6 month contract and I agreed. I was not advised that I was signing up for a recurring monthly charge that would require 30 days notice to cancel. Therefore, in order to sign up for one month I would need to advise that I was cancelling on the day that I signed up. 

After the month was completed and paid for, on XX/XX/XXXX I was charged for a second time {$490.00}. I tried multiple times to contact someone about this and would leave messages with the answering service as the business can not be reached directly. Finally, XXXX XXXX called me back days later and advised that it was a monthly recurring charge. I advised her I had no knowledge of that and she insisted I signed the agreement. I received an email from their "" support '' team finally on XX/XX/XXXX advising that XX/XX/XXXX payment would be my final payment and my membership was valid for the next 30 days. Therefore, in theory I should only be responsible for 2 payments of {$490.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, i received invoice number XXXX in the amount of {$2900.00}. This assumes 5 payments of {$490.00} and a 16 % chargeback fee and a collection fee. I again tried to contact support with no response. Apparently, my messages were received and I received a revised invoice with no explanation on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1100.00}. This assumes 2 payments of {$490.00}, a 16 % chargeback fee and a collection fee. This invoice continues to be incorrect because I already paid {$490.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and that charge was not disputed or declined. 

Instead of correcting their erroneous invoice or responding to my calls, they sent my file to collections with Fein, Such, Kahn & Shepard. This debt collector sent me a debt collection bill in the amount of {$2800.00} which is a wholly inaccurate amount since my account has been cancelled since XX/XX/XXXX. I was only a member for 2 months which is $ XXXX  monthly. This debt collector did not verify the debt before contacting me or is trying to intimidate and harass me by including a larger completely inaccurate amount."

However, the loan has been in default for so long and was originally a no-doc interest only loan. Now the loan, which was originally $ XXXX is now at $ XXXX. Through the help of an attorney, I was finally able to get approved for a trial modification. Except, the amount of the payment is unaffordable and unreasonable. It is nearly {$7500.00} per month. The rep at Shellpoint gave me more details - that the maturity date is per the original, XXXX. And it is adjustable - raising interest points each year. Also that it is based on the original loan amount and the past due payments ( which would have only been interest anyway based on the loan type ). I spoke to the Illinois Attorney General Homeowner Help Line and they feel this is not a modification due to the 13 year maturity date. It should be modified to a 30 year loan. This might explain the high payment, but they sent me no back up figures - only a verbal conversation with the XXXX She basically said "" you can afford it ''. Although I had a good sales year last year ( XXXX ) my average income is $ XXXX. They are basing this on XXXX year of income and a 13 year term. She also told me I could just refinance the loan with another lender - but the house is only worth XXXX - who would give me a XXXX mortgage for a XXXX house????"

My parents have a new insurance carrier as of this year. The former carrier, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), refuses to take calls or correspondence regarding prior coverage. XXXX is also known for not changing emergency visits to in-network to avoid paying valid medical expenses, since when seen in urgent or emergency care, you have no control over the network a physician uses for billing.

My parent 's don't have an Explanation of Benefits ( EOB ) from services provided by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, leaving me unable to verify whether my insurance was ever billed. 

Medical providers should have a responsibility to follow fact-based processes in good faith. They ask for insurance information before they will even see or treat you in an emergency situation. Yet, they don't follow through with the accurate and timely billing of your insurance, or give you an opportunity to ask questions or dispute claims. I should only be responsible for any remaining balance after my insurance pays based on my family 's coverage at the time of service. I do not and did not authorize the release of my information to any third party. National Recovery Agency has damaged my credit based on unverifiable information."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, California XXXX Date of Birth : XX/XX/1992 SS # : XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute several violations of consumer protection laws that have severely impacted my financial well-being and personal peace of mind. I have found myself ensnared in a web of unauthorized credit inquiries, unverified accounts, and inaccuracies on my credit report, causing me substantial distress and detriment. I implore the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to enforce the full weight of the law and rectify these violations promptly. 

My journey with these violations began when I discovered unauthorized inquiries on my credit report. The invasive credit pulls by entities such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX have compromised my privacy and financial stability. These inquiries were conducted without my consent, eroding my trust in the very institutions that should safeguard my sensitive information. 

Beyond these unauthorized inquiries, I have encountered unverified accounts that have left me emotionally and financially distressed. The accounts associated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX have materialized as shadows from the unknown, haunting my credit report without proper verification or explanation. Their presence continues to cast a dark cloud over my financial prospects, impacting my ability to secure loans, obtain favorable interest rates, and achieve life goals. 

In addition to the unauthorized inquiries and unverified accounts, I have endured the torment of inaccurate personal information on my credit report. False previous addresses at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX have tainted my credit history, causing confusion and concern in my personal and professional life. Such inaccuracies reflect a blatant disregard for the importance of accurate credit reporting and have further perpetuated the cycle of distress. 

Allow me to share my personal story to shed light on the profound impact of these violations on my life. As a dedicated individual who values financial responsibility and strives for a secure future, these violations have thrown me into a state of turmoil. The unauthorized inquiries have not only made me feel like my personal boundaries have been violated but have also caused tangible damage by lowering my credit score and limiting my opportunities. The unverified accounts have left me feeling powerless and overwhelmed, as they contribute to a narrative that doesn't accurately represent my financial history and responsible behaviors. Moreover, the inaccuracies in my personal information have complicated my interactions with financial institutions, employers, and potential landlords, creating unnecessary barriers in my pursuit of stability and success. 

In light of these violations and the personal turmoil they have caused, I urge the CFPB to take swift and decisive action. I request that you enforce the legal rights established under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and its relevant sections, such as the protections against unauthorized inquiries ( Section 604 ) and the provisions for accurate reporting and investigation ( Sections 605 and 611 ). Furthermore, I seek your assistance in compelling the relevant creditors and credit reporting agencies to promptly remove the unauthorized inquiries, unverified accounts, and inaccurate personal information from my credit report. 

I implore the CFPB to recognize the urgency of this matter and the emotional toll it has taken on my life. The power to restore my financial integrity and emotional well-being lies within the realm of your expertise, and I trust that you will undertake the necessary steps to ensure justice is served. I kindly request that you keep me informed of the progress and actions taken in resolving this dispute. 

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter. I am hopeful that, with your intervention, I can finally find the relief and resolution I so desperately need. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

They told me I was n't paying enough I never missed a payment I paid them what I could every month nobody would work with me. I 'm currently in the middle of buying my home and saw my score decrease tremendously and could n't understand what happen which puts me in jeopardy of loosing my home ownership opportunity. I reviewed my report and Amex placed a collection on my report  with no phone call or debt validation letter.

I paid them and never missed any payment and I explained to them I could n't pay in full but I am trying to resolve the debt and nobody would help.

In a phone call on XXXX XXXX, XXXX RMS confirmed that {$7000.00} was placed in the set aside. 
Sometime thereafter RMS paid the renewal for Borrower 's insurance policy in the amount of {$3000.00} with funds from the XXXX set-aside. A balance of {$3900.00} was left in the set-aside. In XXXX XXXX Borrower 's property taxes were mailed out by the county property appraiser.

RMS advised Borrower to submit her request in writing. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX Borrower faxed over the request as instructed and received a fax confirmation that her request was successfully transmitted.

The customer service representative "" XXXX '' was not helpful and pretty much told Borrower "" we did n't receive your request. Too bad. Send another ''. 
Borrower is concerned because if the XXXX funds are not used before a certain date, which is fast approaching, the XXXX set-aside will be applied to her loan balance and will not be used for taxes and insurance as intended. This would be egregious and highly prejudicial to Borrower because she has had to give a mortgage to receive the XXXX funds and if the funds are applied to Borrower 's loan balance, she would not receive the intended benefit of the funds and will likely cause her to fall into default."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"In XXXX of 2006, We attempted to refinance our home.

Instead of verifying my income, XXXX  XXXX/Wachovia/Wells Fargo generated an application via their computer system indicating that I was making {$8000.00} per month plus my title was changed from Analyst to Vice President. So without my knowledge, of this fraud, they approved me for a loan that was already illegal to sell to consumers in Illinois ( XXXX mortgage ). Then, they took out a default insurance policy in anticipation of my default. I was also unaware of this policy until I was contacted by XXXX XXXX, advising me of this default policy. They first stated that it was illegal for them to take out a policy without my knowledge. Then they advised me that the bank had put through a claim but was denied because they did not following the federal underwriting guidelines. I also have a letter indicating this from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the default mortgage insurance company ). One year later, the bank used the same exact application indicating my monthly income of {$8000.00} to open an equity line in the amount of {$35000.00}. Firstly, I am not aware of such equity line. There is no proof of funds distributed. Incidentally, there is no proof of any closing for either loan. We also put in about 6 or more complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection bureau. Each time, they lied about the findings. They denied all allegation, claiming they did nothing wrong when the proof was provided. Even though, I provided a letter from XXXX XXXX, they deny any such policy. They even ignore the fact that the same exact application was used a year apart. The notarys signature is also on a blank piece of paper and is dated 1 day after the loan. The mortgage shows about 6 title companies.

The new law states that the old contract has been changed and the tender of payment in full must either be tendered in full or discharged. I have contacted all creditors and was told in response that it takes 7-10 business days for this type of payment to post to my account. It has been over twenty five days and by law the payment was received therefore accepted and payment must show paid in full tendered or discharged. 
"" Under thenew law government obligations, bills of exchange, drafts, notes, trade acceptances, and bankers acceptances, because it is backed by the credit of the nation.It will represent a mortgage on all the homes, and other property of all the people of the nation. '' Senate Document No. 43, 73rd Congress, 1st Session, Congressional Record, March 9, 1933 on HR 1491 p. 83. 
In the beginning all creditors attempted to act like they had not received the Tendered Payment so i provided proof via the United States Post Office, whereas they have on multiple occasions lost or destroyed the mail but with proof of delivery and signed forms 3811 green cards the delivery proof is undeniable, and therefore the payment was received on time and is not late. 
Therefore all are hereby notified that I XXXX XXXX XXXX do hereby tender payment for the above referenced obligation of debt, and because this debt concerns property of the United States it is deemed by law and operation of statute to be a government obligation and must be handled in accord with the dictates of statute. I have accepted the obligation on behalf of the United States of America and hereby make assignment of the obligation to the United States Treasury Department on behalf of the United States of America as authorized by statute. They were to present the item ( remittance coupon ) to the United States Treasury Department or at any Federal Reserve bank to include any Federal Reserve member banks to redeem the value of the obligation. As per the terms of the contract this shall serve as my notice of change in terms of contract, cancelling and or suspending any acceleration penalties and paying the US government debt obligation for value through acceptance pledging an assignment in full. Rather it has been over [ 25 ] twenty five days and nothing has posted as paid tendered or discharged and this disables me XXXX XXXX XXXX by way of doing business employment and living free. 
3-603. TENDER OF PAYMENT. ( a ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX, the effect of tender is governed by principles of law applicable to tender of payment under a simple contract. ( b ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to which the tender relates. ( c ) If tender of payment of an amount due on an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligation of the obligor to pay interest after the due date on the amount tendered is discharged. If presentment is required with respect to an instrument and the obligor is able and ready to pay on the due date at every place of payment stated in the instrument, the obligor is deemed to have made tender of payment on the due date to the person entitled to enforce the instrument. 
If any have declined the Tender of Payment you are now obligated under law to Discharge the debt 3-602. PAYMENT. ( a ) Subject to subsection ( b ), an instrument is paid to the extent payment is made ( i ) by or on behalf of a party obliged to pay the instrument, and ( ii ) to a person entitled to enforce the instrument. To the extent of the payment, the obligation of the party obliged to pay the instrument is discharged even though payment is made with knowledge of a claim to the instrument under Section 3-306 by another person. ( b ) Subject to subsection ( e ) a note is paid to the extent payment is made by or on behalf of a party obliged to pay the note to a person that formerly was entitled to enforce the note only if at the time of the payment the party obliged to pay has not received adequate notification that the note has been transferred and that payment is to be made to the transferee. 
A notification is adequate only if it is signed by the transferor or the transferee ; reasonably identifies the transferred note ; and provides an address at which payments subsequently can be made. Upon request, a transferee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the note has been transferred. Unless the transferee complies with the request, a payment to the person that formerly was entitled to enforce the note is effective for purposes of subsection ( c ) even if the party obliged to pay the note has received a notification under this paragraph.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I have been a victim of extreme theft identity that has spanned  over a 3 ye ar period. Upon several denials for credit early last year, I pulled my credit and noticed a tremendous amount of accounts, inquiries, and discrepancies on my report from all   XXXX    credit bureaus. I then phone contacted each creditor and informed them that I had been a victim of identity theft and asked them to provide original documents showing my hand written or electronic signature signing for the debts/ accounts that were in dispute. I was told that my accounts had been sold to different collection agencies in which they could not or failed to provide accurate account numbers, names/addresses and telephone numbers for them leading to a dead end. After going around in circles, dead ends, and disconnected phone lines I then notified the  XXXX  credit bureaus where an investigation was done between  XXXX  and  XXXX  of  XXXX . I received notification withi n 5 days  that information was verified and accurate with    XXXX    and Experian.    XXXX   on the other hand, took the time to properly investigate with creditors. In turn, most inquiries and accounts that were fraudulent were removed and fraud alert placed on report. I proceeded to send a second certified letter to all   XXXX   credit bureaus in   XXXX   XXXX   after further researching and gaining knowledge of the FCRA guidelines. At that time, I noticed that  XXXX  has reinserted  XXXX  accounts back on my account that was previously disputed and deleted twice without notifying me within  5 days of insertion. After speaking to them about this and their viola tion of the FCRA, they did not remove but stated that it had to be re-disputed for a third time? According to the FCRA section  611  this is in direct violation for not notifying me that it was reinserted and is suppose to be deleted permanently. After that, I sent in a police report and itemized verified/certified letter with each negative account and inquiry to each bureau and then proceeded to contact each bureau around   XXXX   XXXX   after receipt of documents to make sure that they received the items and to comply. According to the FCRA, it states that if I am a victim of identity theft, I have the right to have any incorrect and fraudulent information removed and blocked so that it is not reported again on a consumers report. I stated this to each bureau and the response I got from each was that they have their own guidelines and they ca n't just remove the information and/or block it without doing a FOURTH investigation and contacting the creditors again. They also stated that they do not require the creditors to provide valid details such as original signatures, entire account numbers, etc in order for them to continue to report an account as accurate. This is also in direct violation of the FCRA due to the fact that creditors have to provide valid information such as signatures, dates open, accurate account numbers in order for it to be considered valid. Otherwise, it has to be deleted from report. None of this was provided to me by neither the creditors or credit bureaus. After speaking to a supervisor at Experian name  XXXX  today I am also having an issue with them deleting the name ending in  XXXX  as well as multiple addresses on file that were all used in the identity theft cases to open accounts upon my several wishes to do so. I have also expressed an issue with me calling in on   XXXX   XXXX   to file another dispute for the same accounts that went into an investigation. I was told that I could not file another dispute with Experian for the same thing twice? That is beyond inaccurate. The representative proceeded to file a dispute anyway, but on the  XXXX  of  XXXX  I received my Experian report dated   XXXX   XXXX   that the investigation was complete and all accounts had been verified as being accurate. How was it possible to file and be completed the same exact day I called in? I have  XXXX  accounts in dispute, and there is no way that information from all creditors were in fact reported back to bureau in less than a  24  hour period. I spoke to the supervisor about this and told her that I do not have faith that Experian is properly conducting investigations because of this. She apologized and claimed she did not even see where I even called in on the  XXXX  to initiate another dispute. Strange. After speaking with  XXXX  today about my police report and investigation process and the supervisor name  XXXX   XXXX  informed me that they received my report but that it was either invalid ( as if I stole a report and wrote it mysel f ) o r it did not meet the criteria for  XXXX ?? I then proceeded to ask her what the criteria was and that she was the one I had spoken to previously that told me to get the police report. She told me that they mailed me a letter on   XXXX   XXXX   explaining that they could not use the police report but that they would add it to my file to send to creditors. I kept asking what criteria she was referring to so that I can know and be in compliance of what needed to be done and she told me that she could not disclose that to me. This whole process has become so frustrating and I feel like I am fighting with a bear and losing. I do n't know what else to do besides file a lawsuit against all   XXXX    bureaus as I have caught them in violation of the FCRA guidelines several times and they still will not comply. This strain on my credit and identity theft has caused a financial and emotional hardship for me and my family at least for the past  3 y ears when it was first identified that I had become a victim and I just want this nightmare to be over."
Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Applying for or obtaining a modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or deed-in-lieu","We have complained to Wells Fargo for failing to comply with its duties to assist borrowers during a natural disaster declared by the President of the United States or the Governor of Florida. We are also demanding immediate assistance to prevent XXXX XXXX 's intention of defaulting on the properties we have owned for more than 22 years. Our complaint is based on the following circumstances : Between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, we experienced financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected our tenants and our ability to pay our mortgage statements and fees. We did not receive any forbearance plan during this time. In addition, our location was hit by two hurricanes in XXXX. The first hurricane, Hurricane Ian ( XXXX XXXX  ), occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, causing flooding in two of our properties and significant damage to others, leading to a decrease in our income. The second hurricane, Hurricane Nicole ( XXXX  XXXX ), happened on XX/XX/XXXX, which hindered repairs of the damage caused by Hurricane Ian. 
As a result of our financial difficulties, we sought assistance from Wells Fargo, our mortgage lender, by applying for mortgage assistance, a forbearance plan, or a loan modification. Unfortunately, we did not receive any response from them. In the meantime, Wells Fargo continued to add unjustified fees to our loans, fail to process our payments, send monthly mortgage statements with higher amounts, ignore the payments that were made following the guidelines established for XXXX XXXX  by the United States Bankruptcy Code, request unnecessary information, and in some cases even initiate foreclosure proceedings. Despite our attempts to contact them through email or phone, Wells Fargo did not answer our queries about the situation. 

We have loans with Wells Fargo, but we haven't received any assistance from them. We told them about the condition of our properties due to the hurricanes, but they continued to request lender insurance for the properties. Unfortunately, we were unable to get insurance because the homes wouldn't pass inspections due to the hurricanes, and nobody would insure them due to the extensive number of hurricanes in the state of Florida, as well as the age and condition of the properties. 
Additionally, the monthly mortgage statements show a constant increase in the amounts without any fair reason. Below are the loans we are referring to : XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX : Loan Number : XXXX : - XX/XX/XXXX : Mortgage Statement of {$13000.00}.

We have sent several emails to the Mortgage Company requesting Loss Mitigation Assistance, but we have not received any response from them. We have also requested that our taxes and insurance be escrowed, and we have filed insurance claims for all our properties, stating that we have paid for the repairs out of our own pockets, without any assistance. We believe that our payment processes have been negatively impacted by irregularities, undue delays, and unfair decisions made by the Mortgage Company. However, we can prove that we have always fulfilled our commitments to them in each loan, and we are willing to continue doing so, despite the adverse impact of COVID-19 and Hurricane Ian on XXXX small business. 

Even though Wells Fargo is not registered as a licensed mortgage lender in Florida State, they are still obligated to comply with the Loan Originators and Mortgage Brokers XXXX XXXX Title XXXIII of the Florida Statutes ( XXXX ). However, we believe that they have failed to meet their legal obligations as lenders under federal and state laws in the case of natural disasters. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, these obligations are in place to protect borrowers from financial hardship caused by natural disasters. 

Some of the key legal obligations of lenders during and after a natural disaster are : 1. Mortgage Forbearance : The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act enacted by Congress in XX/XX/XXXX provides mortgage forbearance for federally-backed mortgages for up to 18 months due to COVID-19-related financial hardships. This forbearance applies to natural disasters as well. Lenders must provide borrowers with a forbearance period of at least 90 days for federally-backed mortgages and up to 180 days for non-federally-backed mortgages. During the forbearance period, lenders can not charge late fees, report late payments to credit bureaus, or initiate foreclosure proceedings. 

At this point, we never received at least 90 days of mortgage forbearance, otherwise, we continued receiving charges for late fees and also the increase in our mortgage statements, which made it even more difficult to cover our responsibilities. 

2. Disaster Assistance : Lenders must provide borrowers with information about disaster assistance programs offered by federal, state, and local agencies. This information must be provided in writing and in a language that the borrower understands. Lenders must also provide borrowers with a list of resources that can help them recover from the disaster. 

3. Communication : Lenders must communicate clearly and frequently with borrowers about their options during and after the disaster. This communication must be in a language that the borrower understands and must include information about forbearance, disaster assistance, and any other available resources. 

Regarding points 2 and 3, it is crucial to note that even though we requested mortgage assistance from Wells Fargo and received communications from them, they only informed us that they would review our application. However, in the end, we received a negative response to our application. 

4. Modification of Loan Terms : Lenders may modify loan terms for borrowers affected by the disaster. These modifications may include extending the loan term, reducing the interest rate, or deferring payments. Lenders must provide borrowers with written notice of any loan modifications. 

We were never allowed to modify our loan terms, which resulted in the interest rates and late payment fees increasing each month. We feel that the actions taken by the corporation are unjust and violate our rights."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I entered into a consumer transaction with XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2022. Based on the condition of my credit I was pre approved for {$2000.00} credit limit ( see attached ). I then accepted the application because it would cover what I needed to purchase for my personal and or household goods. After I accepted the offer, I was told that correspondence will be sent to me in the mail. I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX stating that in order to complete my request, we require additional information to verify your identity. So I called the XXXX number provided in the letter ( XXXX ) XXXX and provided the info asked of me. At that time, another pull to my credit report was conducted to which the agent on the phone did not disclose to me that they would pull my credit. I was not informed that my credit limit would be subjected to the condition of my credit report arising from the credit pull on XX/XX/2022. This has caused me serious harm as defined in 18 USC 1589 ( c ) ( 2 ).

Pursuant 1581b ( a ) ( 2 ), my written consent is needed to furnish a consumer report about me. I did not give XXXX XXXX  and XXXX permission to pull my credit on XX/XX/2022 and they did not have the lawful authority to report to a non affiliated third party my nonpublic personal information. On XX/XX/2022 the credit card account was opened and reported to to the credit reporting agencies without my written consent. No consent due to non disclosure is not lawful authority. No consent is aggravated identity theft. It is my right to a fair and equitable credit report. Pursuant 15 usc 1681 ( b ), Im aware that under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Protection Act ( 15 USC 6802 ) my nonpublic personal information should not have been disclosed to any non affiliated third party ( Credit Reporting Agency ) without my lawful consent. 

Furthermore, the agent told me that I was only approved for a credit limited for {$630.00}. I then told the agent and her manager that, that I have already accepted the credit limit of {$2000.00} on the date that I extended my credit on the initial consumer credit transaction in XXXX, XXXX. They then told me that there is no application in the system for that limit. This is a breach of their fiduciary duty. 

See attachments showing proof that : 1. I entered into the transaction in XXXX. 
2. The XX/XX/2022 letter states in order to complete your request proof that an application was accepted in XXXX. 
3. The original credit limit I was approved for which is {$2000.00}.

Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"I started the loan process with Movement Mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. I finally signed a contract on a home in XX/XX/XXXX. This home was new construction and still being built. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX, branch manager whom I'd been dealing with during this process and voiced my concerns that the interest rate was rising ( now at over 3 % ) and I did not want to be priced out. XXXX advised me that he would monitor the rate and that they have meetings every Monday mornings to discuss the trends of the interest rate. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I contact XXXX again expressing that I didn't want to be priced out because at that time the rate was inching to 3.75 %. We discuss the cost of locking the rate and XXXX states since I stayed with Movement Mortgage opposed to using the builders lender, who by the way was offering closing cost assistance, they ( Movement Mortgage ) would cover the cost of the extension. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX I receive paper work to lock the rate for four months at 3.75 % which would have carried me through XX/XX/XXXX. At this time I haven't done my research to know that the first two months of locked rate there is no charge. After many delays the date of delivery was not meet by the builder, which caused the 1st extension which cost me {$710.00} and was for 2 weeks based on a XX/XX/XXXX delivery which was given to me by the builders. That date passed as well which caused an additional extension for another 2 weeks it's costing me an additional {$710.00}. During this time I'm constantly receiving updated paperwork from Movement mortgage and I noticed on one of the documents that something had changed there was now an 0.375 % of the loan amount ( points ) totaling {$1000.00} on the loan documents which wasn't there initially. When I asked XXXX to explain what the points were because I didn't buy down points to get the 3.75 % rate, that was the rate I locked in with, he tells me points can be different things. I asked for a detailed breakdown of all the fees associated with the locked rate, however when he sent this so called breakdown, he failed to include what the points were. I can provide the email he sent. Up until the day before I closed I asked for an explanation of the points but at this time XXXX began to treat me as if he was doing me a favor and in his words and I quote "" she should by grateful for the deal she's getting ''."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Hi, I recently wrote you and this bureau of inaccurate/incorrect information on my report no changes have made thus far. On XX/XX/2021, I wrote Experian asking for them to do the following : On XX/XX/2021 I sent the following dispute letter : To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal request for the description of the procedures used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the disputed information, including the business name, address, and telephone number of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with this reinvestigation. Any dates that you contacted said furnisher of information is also requested to be included in your response. We recently advised you that the below information was inaccurate or incorrect and stated that it has been verified. Thus, were now kindly asking that you provide the furnisher of said information that you contacted in connections with this reinvestigation please : XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ga XXXX Case # XXXX Please remove from my credit report. 
================================================================ I have further advised them in my new dispute that was sent to them certified letter of the following ( also included in the attachment ) : This letter is a final complaint, in an attempt to get you to comply with the FCRA laws, rules, regulations and guidelines. Im advising you that you are continuing to report inaccurate and incomplete credit information. Because of your actions, Im in a tizzy, since you persist on including the above information in my credit profile and have unavailingly assisted in reasonable procedures to satisfy any possible accuracy in the credit reports you publish. ================================================================ I must say that I am in awe that it appears when complaints are filed against these CRA 's that they seem to think they can just give some quick response that they will respond directly to the individual filing complaint so they can close the case. Without any consequences or follow-up from the CFPB. It's stated that part of the CFPB 's consumer responsibility is : We aim to make consumer financial markets work for consumers, responsible providers, and the economy as a whole. We protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices and take action against companies that break the law. -- -with that in mind these bureaus should be under more scrutiny than what have been. I've been hearing about how the CFPB will shut-down, file lawsuits, etc, against Credit Repair agencies , credit monitoring agencies, but somehow it seems to fail us when it comes to the CRA 's XXXX I'm baffled at that this behavior is allowed to continue when you're supposed to be in the business of protecting your consumers. 

In closing, I ask that you, CFPB, make these CRA 's to obey the FCRA 's laws and not just allow them to acknowledge the complaint and then say they'll be in touch with us and close the case only to come back with stall tactics with some bogus explanation about using some credit report agency, which isn't illegal, albeit, I'm doing this myself as you can see I'm very through and long winded here. This make no sense that I have to continue to file complaints when they can just obey the FCRA 's guidelines. It's a well known fact that is easily XXXX, that the CRA 's use these stall tactics which means they are in no way for helping the people at all. I can only pray that you won't be a participant in their process by not continuing to allow them to get away with these actions. The law is the law and they too need to be made to keep it and not disobey/break/ignore it, causing hardship to the consumer. This is unfair and unjust behavior. Please go after them they way you have been going after these credit repair agencies. It's only fair, right??? Treat them all the same, to make them obey the LAWS of FCRA. And clearly they are stalling now that I've asked for them to verify how they got the supplier of that information and how they came about it, etc. None of what I asked for was supplied, rather I got a response of "" it doesn't appear that you wrote this dispute letter and that you may be working with a credit repair agency. '' Wow! Unbelievable. But from my research this doesn't appear to be anything new to the industry. The public has been aware of such stall tactics for many years now and now it's still continuing. It's like the laws are there but then when you ask for the laws to be following immediately they work hard to do everything in their power to continue to break the law ... ..I petition you to not allow this behavior to continue. I have sent multiple dispute letters to the CRA and also to CFPB. They apparently don't care if you report them because it seems they think there will be no consequences. It looks really bad to have a reputation to not follow the laws of the FCRA that were put there to supposedly protect the consumers of USA. Please make the provide all of the verification information that I requested in my XX/XX/2021 dispute letter and if they can't provide the valid/undisputable information that I requested in full, then they must delete that information from my report immediately being that I've been asking for months now since middle of last year for this to be genuinely, accurately verified and if not remove from my report yet they stall and the inaccurate information remains on my report. I must say I've already had one success with one of the bureaus and they removed the information, now I'm waiting on this one to do the same but they seem to enjoy stalling and playing games. Please have them to fully obey the laws of FCRA no more stall tactics."

Upon transferring the mortgage that was in good standing and finally receiving the papers from Carrington Mortgage my loan was immediately anylized by their escrow department and my payment was raised. I called Carrington Mortgage and was told that the reason for the additional charges were because they placed an escrow coushion of the most charges allowable by law. I requested they remove it stating that XXXX XXXX XXXX did this every year but immediately removed it when asked. Carrington Mortgage  refused. Every month since then I have been repeatedly badgered with phone call after phone call every single month. 3-4 or more times per day every day shortly after the XXXX of each month. According to my loan documents my payment becomes due on the first but has a grace period of 15 days and that said, my mortgage is paid every month between the XXXX and before the XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a paper in my statement saying that unless I set up automatic payment I would be charge for online payments or phone payments and as much as {$20.00} for a representative to process a payment. I initially set up auto pay and called several times to check to see if it was activated and it never was. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to a representative on the phone and it still was not set up. I voiced my concern and dissatisfaction about the whole forced auto pay situation and she told me that since I live in North Carolina I was exempt and they could not leagally charge me for a payment that I made online myself. I told her that it was never disclosed or explained to me in any of the previous calls I made and she said that they are not supposed to tell people that. Now I am being bumbarded with calls. Tonight XXXX I answered and the representative asked me a series of questions including asking if we still hold keys to and occupy the property. Again I have until the XXXX to pay my mortgage so I asked why he was asking the questions. He said my mortgage was late and I had to pay it with him over the phone. I told him that he could check the history that my payment have never been late and I already had the payment set up on line. He was extremely condescending and said do you know when your mortgage is do? I said of course I do and he said when? I said it it do the first and I have till the XXXX the to pay and have always paid b4 the XXXX he just kept repeating due when over and over. I told him that I was tired of the constant phone calls and badgering and I did not want them calling me again and that I had stated that already and hung up. I was so furious and insulted. The commission should XXXX the company and read the nightmare of reviews from hundreds of people that have had the same experience as myself. All from people who had no choice but to deal with Carrington because their loans were sold by XXXX XXXX XXXX and Other Banks. This company should be shut down!"

I have never been late on a student loan in my life and there fact that all the good standing loans with the same dates as the derogatory listings that was consolidated in XXXX are still showing on my report is insane to me considering I have disputed this information several times yet due to them having my account mixed with so much false information which makes it unable to b authenticated via internet or phone automated system, and in some cased by their own agents depending on how they pull up my account, the knowledge of the representative or the agents willingness to correctly handle my account. All of my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have been paid on time and consolidated yet since XXXX up to today which is over 7 years they have been knowingly and falsely listing false information on my report. There is no way my loans can be consolidated XXXX and always in good standing from XXXX until that date yet in XXXX I have multiple listings of delinquencies and accounts open in XXXX when all of those loans despite being opened at different times are all handled at the same time when it comes to my consolidation and payment history so how it is that despite it being evident both things can't be true they are still falsely reporting this information and will not provide me with written proof of how this information was verified despite it being contradicting. To make matters worse all the delinquent accounts are showing as still open when all of my loans were consolidated and it's past 7 years and they are still on my report which is also against the law. I have been trying to correct this issue with them since XXXX and they refuse to abide by the law. Back then I did not have time to look up the laws or even know where to look them up. Most of the times laws are abused by those who are in place to enforce them so it doesn't surprise me these agencies are allowed to get away with this. They cause people to have higher interest rates, get denied for business opportunities, not qualify for things they may need, look uncredited worthy all be cause they chose to outsource to foreigners who do not know the American Legal system, can barely understand the account holder or comprehend what the person is stating due to cultural differences. How is that even legal, they have staff who aren't even qualified to manage consumer accounts due to lack of knowledge of American Laws and processes, so these things just stay on a consumers report while these agencies get paid for reporting negatively despite knowing the information is false and the consumer gets screwed for years with no restitution for what has been done to them."

Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Unknown,"We signed paperwork with Flagstar bank in XX/XX/XXXX to complete a VA loan modification for our home that was in COVID forbearance. We made the first payment on this loan on XX/XX/XXXX, per the terms of that agreement. At the same time, due to having no faith that Flagstar was following the correct VA procedures, we placed our home for sale and planned to leave California. The home was sold on XX/XX/XXXX. When our closing escrow company called for the final payoff with Flagstar bank, it was without the partial claim amount that was created as part of the loan modification. 

This caused several issues, but the escrow company agreed to withhold the funds + {$20000.00} of our own funds in reserve, to ensure payoff when the partial claim was finally settled. Because Flagstar did not work with the VA properly to process the loan modification ( per XXXX XXXX, VA Loan Technician XXXX - XXXX EXT. XXXX ) the partial claim still exists at Flagstar bank. My repeated calls to Flagstar Bank continuously end in 'escalation ' to management/underwriting that frustratingly lead nowhere. All I need is the proof that the partial claim still exists at Flagstar bank, so that my escrow can be fully closed. 

Additionally, Flagstar bank repeatedly sent me to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who struggled mightily to help me, but they never received the partial claim and therefore could not help me. It was XXXX who escalated to the VA, who confirmed the error was with Flagstar Bank. Having been a Flagstar customer who routinely witnessed the bungling of even simple processes and the poor call center employees who seem powerless to help, I am not surprised that Flagstar bank found another way to XXXX things up. It's almost as if the company has decided it's purpose is to be obstructionist with respect to servicing of loans, and VA loans in particular. This is my second CFPB complaint in regards to Flagstar Bank. No other institution has ever led me to create another one."

On XXXX @ XXXX XXXX, I called an agent of WESTLAKE FINANCIAL XXXX on a recorded call ) to discuss the debt amount, which I was uncertain of. The agent assured me that I was in good standings with one future payment submission and had no worries of ANY action taken against me, as long as the account was not 60 plus days behind. I still felt unsettled about the amount owed and questioned the validation of the debt, so I sent ( via certified mail ) a request for WESTLAKE FINANCIAL to provide information pertaining to the validation of this debt. 

Since sending the request, WESTLAKE FINANCIAL has completely changed their demeanor, and previous level of customer service that I had been accustomed to. My account balance since, seemed to have been altered to display an additional payment amount that put me 90 days in the rear. WESTLAKE FINANCIAL has also engaged in numerous other FDCPA violations. They used harassing tactics, by way of repeated emails, demanding I pay NOW ( with no proof of validation sent, or no corresponding email address included to ask them to stop harassing me ). During work hours emails continued to pop up DEMANDING payment for the debt in question. Even after the hours of XXXX and even on the weekends. I received multiple harassing communications, back to back phone calls even after requesting to not be communicated by phone or email, but via mail. 

Then in the middle of the night, hours before one of my biggest work meetings, they repossessed my car. This has led to a great deal of financial hardships and mental stress to myself & family ; that included but are not limited to, loss of a valued company client, significant additional financial burdens ( such as a cash advance loan was taken to deal with the inconvenience of no transportation ), missed work opportunities for family members, lack of needed access to personal properties ( such as ; daily prescribed medications left in the car overnight, wife 's work equipment, neighbors work tools ), etc. 

Westlake Financial disregarded my request to send validation of this debt. 15 U.S.C. 1692g - Validation of Debt. as well as 15 U.S.C. 1692c - Communication in connection with debt collection & 15 U.S.C. 1692d - Harassment or abuse.

Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"Wells Fargo has misapplied payments on my loan ( # XXXX ) in XXXX causing me to be in default due to their admitted error. On XXXX/XXXX the payment was received and applied to the XX/XX/XXXX payment, loan was current. {$970.00} paid on XX/XX/XXXX by their request should have applied to the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments. Why would Wells Fargo apply as a principal balance payment when there were XXXX payments due? Another normal payment of {$410.00} was sent in XX/XX/XXXX that at that point should have been applied as a current payment for XX/XX/XXXX. Then as their letter provided continues to state, they keep attempting to apply it to payments not yet due, so it is rejected. If the loan had past due payments, why arent the funds being applied to the past due amount? 

I have continued to make the monthly payment since their error and even though I pay every month, I am still considered in default. I have continually been assessed late charges due to Wells Fargos error of misapplying these payments and forcing me to be in default. The late charges of {$1000.00} need to be reversed and the funds applied to the principal payments need to be reversed and applied to the overdue payments to bring the loan current as they should have been in the first place. 

I can not tell you how many people have promised to remove the over {$1000.00} in late fees over the years and have never done it. I even spoke to Wells Fargo life events team lead named XXXX XXXX four times between XXXX XXXX of XXXX and she agreed with me that the late fees would be removed and she said her assistant XXXX would take care of it and to give her 24 hours. It has been over XXXX months later and they still have not been removed and this letter says they have no plans to remove them because my mother XXXX XXXX, the holder of the loan, had passed away in XXXX and they didnt get rid of the late fees for deceased people until XXXX. All that means is they stopped charging me phantom late fees ( even though we arent late ), but her having passed away has nothing to do with this. Its all about Wells Fargo misapplying the payments and no late fees would ever have been charged if they wouldve been applied correctly. They acknowledge they misapplied the payments in their letter but they say too much time has passed to reverse them. This is on them, not on me. I only sent in the money they requested and they misapplied it and here I am 10 years later still arguing over this! I have requested a payment history back in XX/XX/XXXX and they did not come up with it until XX/XX/XXXX, after continually asking for extensions. Any help you can give me in resolving this would be greatly appreciated. I dont want to lose my home over a clerical error. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

They told me it was my financial institutions responsibility to refund the money. This is incorrect, all my bank can do is issue me a new debit card. They said Experian is responsible for the refund due to them being the one who actually received the money, which only makes sense.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"This is being filed against Bayview Loan Servicing LLC. I have had numerous previous complaints filed in which BLS just makes willfully false statments. The last such complaint was XXXX. <P/>I am going to do this now by just dealing with one issue per complaint rather than identifying various correlated issues. This will compel them to just deal with one per complaint so that the semantically games, and other attachments they submit that are incomplete and incorrect, mostly irrelevant or uncorroborated, and uncorroborable without the proper and full depiction is not further used as the ruse they commonly initiate to inundate you with a lot of papers of little to no substantive value. <P/>
I will first deal with their response to item 3 of complaint XXXX. <P/>XXXX Bayview wrote : "" 3. He request that Bayview send him the name and contact information of the owner of his loan accounts. Bayview provided him with just a name and address and stated the owner of the loan was XXXX XXXX XXXX. He contacted XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX, research analyst for XXXX XXXX. XXXX.

XXXX a letter identifying the correct owner of the loan as XXXX XXXX XXXX as XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, MN XXXX, XXXX ( copy enclosed ). '' XXXX The complaint on this item alone by me is that : 1 ) Bayview made a false statement that it initially provided me with XXXX XXXX XXXX as the owner of the loan on XX/XX/XXXX. In fact they gave me that information after numerous requests in XXXX, and early XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ). ( see attachment BLS Validation of Debt ... ) 2 ) Bayview further has not provided me with correct information regarding the contact information and possibly the true owner of the loans to date. The phone number provided by Bayview XXXX is not a number available for use by myself. It is only for investors who hold parts of the investments with XXXX XXXX. I still can not ascertain whether this is the actual owner, or what the particulars of the agreement are ( if there is one ). I sent BLS a letter ( email ) in response to that issue of the incorrect phone contact number, etc, and have heard nothing back from them or their attorneys.

Debt collection,Private student loan debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Hello, Last year I filed a complaint using Dept. of education and CFPB about this exact issue and while it seems that Dept. of Education 's explanation of COVID federal student aid relief was incorrect ( as was my own state Senator 's ) the combined complaints got NAVIENT to actually pay attention to my current IDR and got off my back and stopped falsely reporting missed payments ( considering you can't miss a payment if your payment is $ XXXX ). 
It's just frustrating that my IDR was good till around XXXX or so and I just recertified yet NAVIENT started asking for repayment before that and ignored my contact attempts to remind them that I'm up to date. And I just submitted my new one with the paperwork for my income- I'm literally making about $ XXXX currently and that barely covers my {$800.00} in rent and I did have food stamps but currently Oregon has a massive backlog on recertifying so I don't even have that right now. Like do I have to go down in person and submit this income verification!? And why did they just stop at a random date on my IDR? On my end I show a completed IDR done end of XX/XX/2022 and I started getting payment requests in XXXX. They are super difficult to deal with and seemingly just ignore or my verification stuff just "" vanishes ''. 
The worst part too is that their negligence resulted in a massive ding to my credit which ended up costing me a really good place to live! I'm currently staying friends who are getting a divorce and will likely sell the house in XXXX and while I'm working on job certifications and training to move into better paying jobs I need around another half year of studying and training but now I have to worry more about finding suitable living arrangements by XXXX and that puts me in a really bad position now.

I was told that it is their policy to only report timely payments after 60 days of purchasing the loan. I pointed out that it was now 102 days after my 1st payment was due and they indicated that they would not be reporting anything on my loan to the agencies until after XX/XX/XXXX. I requested that they make an exception as I am trying to refinance while interest rates are still reasonable and that they have clearly had my loan greater than 60 days. They refused to correct their error and I am now in a difficult position as the underwriter will not approve my new loan without this loan and the timely payments appearing on my credit report.

I have also reached out to all 3 credit bureaus numerous of times trying to resolve this issue. This account is reporting different Payment histories to all three credit bureaus. Every time I try to dispute the issue it has been returned back to me that this account is reporting accurate. I have disputed this account more than 5 times. This is hurting me tremendously and it seems as if no one is willing to take the time out to correct the issue. Credit bureaus get smart and state that Companies can report what they want and do not want to report. I am trying to gain custody of my daughter and i can not do that if my credit history is not reporting accurately for me to even rent a decent home to stay. I am tired of living in shelters. I am tired of having to share space. If someone could just please take the time out to look at what is being reported and correct the issue. I have also provided screenshots so that you can take a look for yourself.

Take action immediately you are in violation. 

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown. 

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated.. i recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes. 

1. The following personal information is incorrect Account Number : Current Address ( es ) : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - This address belongs to someone else. Delete it from my report immediately.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I closed out my XXXX Credit card ( XXXX CARD ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX and they agreed there should not be a derogatory remark on my credit report. I also spoke to Experian who also did an investigation and they agreed with me as well back in XX/XX/XXXX. As of today XX/XX/XXXX, my credit report still shows a negative remark for XX/XX/XXXX when I closed this account. For goodness sakes, pleaser help me get this negative remark removed from my credit report. For whatever reason, Experian will not remove it from my report, and this negative remark only shows up on Experian. It looks to me like they just want me to pay for boost to have them clean it up but that's extortion, and I shouldn't have to pay to have it removed. No other credit reporting agency shows this negative remark, and the mortgage company I am using only uses Experian. Sounds like a scam to me. 

I have not missed a payment on my credit cards for as long as I can remember, so this negative remark is XXXX. Plus add to this nonsense that I have been reducing my credit card balances for substantially over the last three years and yet Experian has chosen to rapidly decrease/increase/decrease my credit score over the last couple of months with large point swings just as I am trying to get a mortgage. This is absolutely ridiculous. 

Ever try to get Experian on the phone? It's next to impossible as you get caught in an endless recorded loop that does not end up with a live agent. What a total scam of a company, I wonder how much they kick back to the mortgage companies to use their horrible reporting service. Lastly, when I was able to get someone on the phone a few months ago, they told me that they don't make up the score, only report it. What are they talking about, it's there credit score that they calculated from their credit factors, so that makes no sense at all?"

In their response they didn't even attempt to address because they said it wasn't me, XXXX XXXX and that I didn't authorize CFPB to investigate. 

Thus, I will include a copy of my driver 's license and SSN to verify my identity and I also give CFPB authorization to send this complaint and I also checked the box at the end of this complaint. Moreover, I sent this dispute by mail to Experian a week ago so they should receive it now. Below you'll find the letter I sent to Experian dated XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX SSN : XXXX XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX Experian XXXX. XXXX  XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX Dear Legal Services : To protect consumers against being reported as delinquent if they utilize these options, the CARES Act calls for creditors to adjust how they report accounts that have been modified. Especially during this pandemic and according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), you are required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report. As you ascertain the accuracy of the information, please send to me as stated the signed contract, previous correspondence, payments made from my account, phone records, and receipts to anyway, shape or form provide contradiction to my assertions. 

Furthermore, it is my understanding you record all calls and on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  EST I directly spoke with one of your agents. She explained to me your dispute process and she simply stated consumers send you information and you then send to data furnishers. I asked her to repeat it and she did. To me, this clearly doesnt constitute a reasonable investigation to verify the accuracy of the information. 

Moreover, under the provision of the CARES Act in relation to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the credit obligation or account was delinquent before the accommodation, during the accommodation the furnisher can not advance the delinquent status. For example, if at the time of the accommodation the furnisher was reporting the consumer as 30 days past due, during the accommodation the furnisher may not report the account as 60 days past due. 

Hence, Im writing these various accounts have been compromised during this pandemic and inaccurate reporting has repeatedly occurred with late payments when I have communicated directly with data furnishers. So, with all of these consistent inaccuracies in combination with clear evidence you dont conduct reasonable investigations and with the previous disputes where you acknowledged my assertions arent frivolous, I demand you permanently block and delete the following accounts. 

Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payments Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payments Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payment Instruction : The payment history is incorrect. 

Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payments Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payments Moreover, permanently delete and block the following late payments in accordance with FCRA and provisions afforded under the pandemic. 

Late Payment Creditors Account Numbers Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payments Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX  Reason : Incorrect late payments Account Name : XXXX Account Number : XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payment Instruction : The payment history is incorrect. 

Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payments Account Name : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXXXXXX XXXX Reason : Incorrect late payments Whenever furnishers provide information to consumer reporting agencies, they have obligations related to the accuracy and integrity of the information they furnish under the FCRA and Regulation V. They have violated their responsibility so its time for you as CRA to block and delete aforementioned accounts. Furthermore, furnishing a special comment code indicating that a consumer with an account is impacted by a disaster or that the consumers account is in forbearance does not provide consumer reporting agencies with this CARES Act-required information and therefore furnishing such a comment code is not a substitute for complying with these requirements. The consumer reporting protections of the CARES Act continue to apply to the time period that was covered by the accommodation after the accommodation ends. 

Moreover, you arent accurately upholding the duties of furnishers in all of these cases due to my accounts being compromised have not established and implemented reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to consumers like that it furnishes to a consumer reporting agency. The policies and procedures must be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of each furnisher 's activities. Please have the data furnishers share with me their policies if you dont delete my accounts. 

Additionally, the consumer 's performance or other conduct concerning an account or other relationship with the furnisher, such as direct disputes relating to the current payment status, high balance, date a payment was made, the amount of a payment made, or the date an account was opened or closed. In all my previous dispute you never investigated it properly and thoroughly. 

Lastly, I have evidence here that the information reported was inaccurate and the data furnishers allowed me to promptly notify each consumer reporting agency to which the furnisher provided inaccurate information of that determination and provide to the consumer reporting agency any correction to that information. Hence and again, please block and delete aforementioned accounts. 

All in all, youve repeatedly violated FCRA and all I request at this juncture is the swift removal of these accounts. Do note Ive made specific complaints to the CFPB under FCRA and CARES Act.

Debt collection,Other debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Back in late XXXX of 2020, my boyfriend and I made plans to move into an apartment. We were all set to move in when COVID-19 hit our area XX/XX/2020. By that time, jobs were closing down, and I soon found myself unemployed, as my job shut down, too. I wasn't making any income to even attempt paying off this collection, and am still making no income from the effects of this pandemic. I'm still struggling to find any means of pay. In addition, my boyfriend lost a lot of his work hours, so we were making little to nothing. Even if we did move in, we would not have been able to pay the monthly rent. We still can not afford the monthly rent, let alone this debt collection that, for some reason, was charged on both of our accounts. The amount we were charged with is the total yearly payment on our apartment, times two. Blakely Witt & Associates is charging both of us {$18000.00}, which isn't applicable in the slightest since we aren't making anywhere near that much money, and if we were going to live together in the same apartment, it baffles me that we are both being charged this much for it. We'd be having to fork out a total of {$36000.00}. We don't make that kind of money at all! I attempted to file a dispute through XXXX  on XX/XX/2020 for these sudden charges, but as of today, both companies have reviewed my dispute and stated that my debt collection remains in my account, and wasn't removed. This isn't fair for us, because my boyfriend 's mother was planning to move into an apartment in the same complex, yet she was able to dispute her debt collection that charged her around the same amount from the same company. She opted out of moving in because of the coronavirus, as well."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"15 US Code 1692- Congressional findings and declaration of purpose ( a ) Abusive practices There is abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors. Abusive debt collection practices contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy. 

( e ) Purposes It is the purpose of this subchapter to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses. 

First, XXXX XXXXXXXX website states when an account is charged off, payment arrangements can no longer be made with them to pay it off ( sent in attachment photos ), BUT I PAID XXXX XXXXXXXX DIRECTLY FOR THIS CHARGED OFF BALANCE Ive already disputed this account due to inaccuracy of reporting, timing of payments, unfair collection practice, misleading representation etc. 

1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. 

( b ) Reasonable procedures It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter. 

Account came back verified accurate after Disputing : XXXX XXXX has verified all reported information is accurate. 

If this is true, then why is there still inaccurate/incomplete information reporting across Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX for this XXXX XXXXXXXX account? 

For example : 2 of my reports reflect charge off and on one it reflects written off. 
Charge off is a current reflection, written off is a post/past reflection If it should be reflecting as charge off then the reflection should show charge off continued though the current month we are in, after the dispute update. 
If it should be reflecting as written off then the update should only reflect 1 month of that status and none after the month reported. 

My Transunion report states this account has a Maximum Delinquency of 120 Days AND is reporting 120 Days delinquent in excess of 1 month. XXXX reports 150 days late before charge off/written off. And XXXX doesnt even have the information reporting. Each agency has information missing from my report that another, if not both other, agency ( s ) has reportingTHIS IS INACCURATE REPORTING. 

Additionally, when I log on to the XXXX app ( Which is a clear extension of representation ) there is additional incorrect/incomplete information showing reported. 

When I try to dispute through the application/online, I am limited to the amount of characters I can use to express the validity of my dispute ( 210 ), which is also misrepresentation of accessible disputing option ( s ). 

I have attached photos of the issues related to this dispute. 
The attempts to collect this debt has come with many unfair practices involving the accuracy reporting. 

The information is still inaccurate after requesting for it to be updated and/or removed from my report and receiving Verified Accurate Updated response. I am no longer requesting updates, Im Requesting removal of this XXXX XXXX balance immediately, and I am including just some of the laws broken during this reporting. Ive kept every report, dispute, and response related to this issue. Since this is a follow up dispute about the same account, the responding deletion should be just as prompt. Please remove this account from my report, thank you.

Verification of Debt : Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I kindly request that you provide me with detailed information about the debt, including the original amount owed, the dates of the alleged transactions, and any supporting documentation that confirms my liability for this debt. It is my right to receive accurate and comprehensive information, and I am eager to review any evidence you may have. 

Cease and Desist Communication : In accordance with my rights under the FDCPA, I am formally requesting that you cease and desist all communication with me until the alleged debt is properly verified and substantiated. Please ensure that all collection activities, including phone calls and written correspondence, are paused until this matter is resolved. 

Validation of Creditor 's Authority : Please provide documentation establishing your authority to collect on behalf of Synchronic Bank. I am entitled to confirm the legitimacy of your claim and the legality of your actions in pursuing this alleged debt. 

Resolution Process : I am open to resolving this matter promptly and amicably.

1. Over 10 years ago, I declared bankruptcy. My mortgage was not included and I have been working very hard to rebuild my credit. My mortgage with with a different servicing company at that time. 
2. This company keeps me in the "" bankruptcy department only '' category and it is extremely hard to get any correct information about my account. 
3. This mortgage has been current for years. 
4. Due to COVID, I requested a forbearance. At the end, I applied for a modification in hopes of a rate reduction to lower the payments. XXXX XXXX relies on public schools and I am fearful of income losses getting worse by the end of this school year. They forecibly kept trying to get me to continue the forebearance like I would have so much money at the end to just pay them then. I sent in my paperwork for the application for modification I called for the status atleast weekly. At one point was told it was in underwriting. I never rec 'd anything. I then suddenly got a letter that the derferal was approved. I called because I discussed this many times with loss mit. 
5. I just wanted to move on and hoped I would not have to worry too much about this. I began making payments right away at the amount I had been paying prior to covid. In XXXX. I rec 'd a letter that my account was 3 months behind. I verified the payments had been made with my bank first, then went to check my loan care account online. I was locked out. I called and was told that my payments were there but "" in a suspense account and it will all catch up once they are done updating deferral details. its in good standing though. There will be an escrow shortage and a statement will generate once everything is caught up for the difference. "" I continued to make the monthly payments. 
6. XXXX. I rec 'd a statment for approximately {$63.00} and paid it believing this must be the escrow shortage that they told me to expect. 
7. 2nd week of XXXX. I rec 'd a statement showing that I am now suddenly 1 month behind, with 1 month due a week and a half ago. Plus late fees. I called in immediately. Calling is near impossible with this company. I urge you to try to get through. I was told again that the system was finally catching up and that I do owe the two payments, but the late fee was waived because it caught up AFTER the last statement went out. I asked if once I pay the 2 payments, my account would be fully caught up. I was assured it was fine and that this was the last time it would happen. 
8. I got a notification from my credit reporting app stating my credit score went down last night. I looked to see it shows that Loan Care is reporting me as 30-60 days past due but does not show when. I called in again and was told that the service agent agrees it it not my fault. She will put in a "" ticket to see IF they will review it. '' I had asked why I can not get into the online account. She told me that it was because the system thought I was in poor standing.

I spent an hour on hold ( yet again ) calling several different numbers, but still Experians excuse for customer service, refused to even answer the phone. I've been defrauded of money.

Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,Unknown,"CFPB Complaint USAA Mortgage USAA is referred to herein as the "" lender ''. 
All agreements to transact real estate were made on the basis of a 15-yr 3.0 % mortgage with 5 % down payment as approved in the prequalification process with USAA. When lender later disqualified the applicant, the only options given to the applicant were 30-year terms and interest rates near 3.75 %. In addition, the lender then enforced a 10 % minimum down payment. 
Central to this complaint is that the lender baselessly ( or without disclosing the basis ) disqualified the applicant 's rental property income ( $ XXXX/month ) while using the rental property 's mortgage ( PITI = $ XXXX/month ) as a debt in calculating the applicant 's Debt-to-Income ratio. The disqualification of this income is not a FNMA policy and the loan processor could not state the basis or origin for this decision. Upon this news, the applicant tried to remove himself from the USAA loan and change lenders on the sales contract, but this was rejected by the Seller. 
As a result in order to get the 15-year mortgage, the applicant now has to refinance with different lender in order to receive the negotiated rate and term, but now must pay all closing costs again. 

The complaints are summarized as follows : 1. Prequalified the loan applicant for a loan product for which he was disqualified after entering into a sales contract. 
2. Initially given no interest rate option that did not include points. 
3. Enforced a minimum down payment by virtue of the property being considered a condominium, even though it could be legally considered a single family detached property. 

Proposed remediation Refund all closing costs from the USAA mortgage."

Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"Ive personally been a client of American Express since XXXX possessing multiple cards including their highly touted XXXX  card. Ive never been late or close to it in those 15 years as a client. My employers company card is an American Express XXXX  card which allow me as an employee to use the card for business purposes only and the company pays the card balance. Evidently my employer paid some of the company credit card balances late in XXXX and American Express tacked on late fees to the balance. Please note every card transaction was paid by my employer but American Express continued to bill late charges on top of other late charges totaling {$520.00}, again all of this is late charges on a company credit card. Now American Express is coming after me for this balance After months of badgering me about a company credit card balance I regrettably gave in to the collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that had started reaching out to me on behalf of American Express. We had an arrangement, I sent the check as promised for the agreed upon amount and date Only to later find out that American Express had taken the account from this collection agency and gave it to another collection agency. This practice has continued over the past 4 months which includes 3 different collection agencies. Additionally XXXX XXXX hasnt cashed nor returned the check I mailed to them. 

I think these practices are unjust and unfair on multiple fronts and I would like to have these resolved as soon as possible : Why am I personally being billed for a company credit card where the transactions have been paid in full?"

Debt collection,Medical debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"I began recieving calls from a company claiming to be a debt collection agency. They claimed that I had an unpaid medical bill from a hospital that I had been to, but I had never received any such bill or communication from the hospital itself and thought I had already paid all of the bills incurred during my visit. Further, the debt collection agency said they had sent written letters/bills to me, but they did not have my correct address. When I provided my correct address I began receiving bills but never received evidence of the original hospital bill or what the charge was for. Further, the letters were not printed on letterhead, were never in the same format, listed different amounts due within the same bill, and the only payment option listed was to mail in a check. They then called me again asking me to pay, and only then gave an online payment option, which had no login information, account information, or way to confirm the amount owed, and I was expected to just enter an amount to pay without any security or confirmation that this information was correct. They have continued to call me regularly to collect the debt, which at this point I don't even think is real."

Then, I received a notice that they were sending the bogus, non-return fee to collections. I finally got hold of a supervisor and after about a half-hour, she was able to see that they had been sending the kits to my old address ( the house I had sold ). She verified my forwarding address and sent a kit. I told her that this better not show up on my credit report and she said it wouldn't as soon as they received the equipment.

I thought I was making payments for the repairs and now am being told that I am in a lease and if I do not pay the additional {$2800.00} that legal action would be taken. I have received messages at my work and on my cell phone from this collection company. I would like to have this resolved. I have paid the amount of the repair and do not plan on making any additional payments. I feel like I have been taken advantage of this is a high interest lease that I was not aware of. I did not sign a lease and would like this resolved and closed out. I do not feel that I should need to pay any more than the repairs.

Because of the carelessness of XXXX XXXX I have been denied credit based on their furnished information which is materially misleading in evaluating my creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"Shellpoint took over loan servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. Starting XX/XX/XXXX, we set up an automatic bill pay through XXXX XXXX, directing them to pay Shellpoint {$4800.00} on the XXXX day of every month, representing the monthly {$11000.00} PITI and an additional {$3000.00} principle reduction. The attached monthly statements show that those payments were correctly made on the XXXX day of every month, starting XX/XX/XXXX and continuing through XX/XX/XXXX. 

Shellpoint claims they never received the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments. When they got the XX/XX/XXXX payment, they applied it to the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX PITI payments and showed the XXXX PITI payment as being short. As of early XXXX, two {$4800.00} payments, a total of {$9600.00}, were floating around somewhere in Shellpoint 's system and not properly credited to our account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, they finally found the most of the missing payments and applied them to our account. However, they are still missing a {$3000.00} principle reduction payment that was supposed to be credited on XX/XX/XXXX. And, the icing on the cake? They have reported as as being 60 days late to the credit bureaus. I found out about this today when I applied with XXXX  to refinance another property we own. My credit score has dropped from over 800 to  under 680 and our refinancing application has been denied. We can lock in a 2.75 % for 15 years with rates at historical lows. Who knows what the rates will be when Shellpont finally straightens this out? 

I have been in communication with at least three different loan servicing agents at Shellpoint and have multiple e-mail exchanges to prove it. NO ONE has been able to figure out where our payments went. We even started getting collection calls and pre-foreclosure notices. This has been an EXTREMELY frustrating experience and now I have to deal with a sub-par credit score through absolutely no fault of our own. 

I expect to be made whole as a result of their negligence.."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,In XX/XX/XXXX I filed a dispute with equifax stating 2 items were being reported incorrectly. One I tem was XXXX XXXX XXXX in which they never investigated and I continued to send in requesting new investigations and still nothing they totally ignnore. at the end of the year XXXX I get item investigated.and remains. Thats 360 days it took to investigate this item has 30 days but they kept ignoring. Now they say was investigating but no information is available on this account buy account holder so how investigation was done is beyond me. Equifax violated federal law as it has 30 days to respond not one year and is and should be fine. I sent them a new letter in which they signed for on XX/XX/XXXX telling them od the fraud they have committed and to remove the account its now XX/XX/XXXX and they have ignored and have not responded back. This item goes why beyond fed limits and they should be fined which is my next step as it has cause great distress. Next at the same time account XXXX XXXX XXXX was also received on XX/XX/XXXX by Equifax. This item was previously removed in XX/XX/XXXX then put back on after removed and disputed for a year not 30 days then they after a one year investigation which is illegal come back and add time on to a loan that was paid off XX/XX/XXXX and show it being paid all the way though XXXX and marked status 120 late. Now they ignored my request that they received on XX/XX/XXXX to remove and havent responded and its now XX/XX/XXXX. This is also a serious violation of federal law. How can a loan paid off in XX/XX/XXXX show late 120 days a year after account was closed.. They flat out ignored both my requests not only in XXXX but now XXXX. This has cost much damages to my credit score as well as taken much of my time to write letters to try and correct and only to be ignored. Such failure of federal law should entitle me to 1000s of dollars..This is total neglect of their responsiblities. I dont wish for a new investigation as they have botched up and ignored 1 plus years of request. I want these items totally removed as well as some kind of compensation for there neglect of duty.

Initially when I called Experian to complain ( my 1st complaint ) about my report and FICO score they said I would n't be charged {$19.00} which was showing as pending when I made the call on XX/XX/XXXX Experian charged my account anyway. I called once on XX/XX/XXXXand another time the week of XX/XX/XXXX to ask them to remove the charge again. The second time they said just ask XXXX XXXX to remove the charge. I said if I do that I am reporting it as fraud. You made the charge for the month of XX/XX/XXXX after I cancelled the account in XX/XX/XXXXand you agreed not to charge me. Experian reluctantly agreed to remove the charge. By XX/XX/XXXX the charge still was not removed ( 2 months after it was charged ). I reported it to XXXX XXXX who removed the charge on XX/XX/XXXX and sent me the attached letter. Obviously Experian ca n't be trusted to correct their own simple billing errors. As I said in my previous complaint : Experian should stop worrying about their sales of credit cards and products and fulfill the job of a credit reporting agency fairly. As the Experian reps told me - Experian has no control over their credit reporting agency, the policies and procedures of their agency, the credit reports they produce, or the FICO scores their agency produces that affect millions of consumers ability to get credit at fair rates based on their credit score and credit reporting history. Experian should step out of the primary credit reporting and scoring company until they can get their act together. Because if this happened to me it has certainly happened to hundreds of thousands if not millions of others. XXXX who has none of these problems should take the lead as primary credit reporting agency for the sake of millions of consumers who need fair and accurate credit reporting and credit scores."

High Credit : XXXX reports a high credit limit of {$650.00}, while TransUnion and XXXX both show a high credit of {$0.00}. This discrepancy could be a violation of FCRA section 607 ( a ), which requires credit reporting agencies to follow "" reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy '' and to provide information in a way that is "" fair and equitable to the consumer. '' Date Last Active : TransUnion and XXXX both show a last active date of XX/XX/2018, while XXXX shows a last active date of XX/XX/2018.

I've already been denied credit because of their inaccurate reporting. I informed them of this and even included the credit denial in the dispute letter I sent. That denial is still on my credit report. 

This is the SECOND TIME I've sent this information to Trans Union. In 2016 I sent my driver 's license, social security card and a utility bill to prove that my maiden name was no longer valid. And they did nothing. 

Trans Union is flagrantly violating the law and their inaccurate reporting is, and has, ruined my chances for credit and caused me severe and grievous harm."
Debt collection,Medical debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"I received an initial notification from Wakefield and Associates in regards to an alleged debt owed to XXXX XXXX. After checking my insurance and personal records I was unable to locate a record of this provider nor of the balance they are claiming. While I do not dispute having been in the hospital around the time of service due to the number of providers and number of bills I have received prior to making arrangements for payment I needed the debt validated so I can ensure this is a valid balance. As such the following has occurred : XX/XX/XXXX - Date of the initial demand letter received XX/XX/XXXX - I submitted a dispute to Wakefield via their consumer portal at https : //www.wakeassoc.com/ and received a generic confirmation back in my email XXXX that the email was received and someone will be in contact. 

**To date I have not received validation documents from Wakefield via email or mail XX/XX/XXXX - Received call from Wakefield @ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Received call from Wakefield @ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Based on my knowledge of the collection agency and reputation for being compliant with the FDCPA I assumed these calls were in error as they had not validated the debt. As a courtesy to the collection agency I submitted a second letter of dispute in the same method as above. The letter sent on this date is as follows : XX/XX/XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to give your company the benefit of the doubt, I was previously in the XXXX  in XXXX and know Wakefield has a pretty solid record. 

I submitted a dispute to your office on XX/XX/XXXX requesting validation ; I am unfamiliar with this provider and have no records of them. To date I have not received the supporting documentation from your office so I may review my records. 

As of today I have received the following calls from your office : XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX As I said based on my knowledge of your company and its operations I am going to give the benefit of the doubt that this was simply an oversight, the validation was lost in the mail, or simply an honest mistake. This will however be the only time I extend such a courtesy to your company. 

As of today I am going to consider the FDCPA violations an honest mistake and wave my rights to peruse such violations and will give your company until Wednesday  ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to update this record and will consider any phone calls up to that point as an honest mistake ; please note that my waver of rights expires at XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX and any violations after that time I reserve the right to bring action on. 

That said this is NOT a request to cease and desist communication and once you have provided me with the documentation for this account I would welcome your office to contact me regarding it. If the account is valid I will be more than happy to arrange repayment however based on the information I am not convinced of the validity. 

For your convenience you are welcome to email me the documents at XXXX if your company allows it. I wave any right to privacy allowed to me under state or federal law with regards to email communications. 

Should email be against your company policy please mail the requested documentation to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NV   XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Received call from Wakefield @ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Received call from Wakefield @  XXXX To date I have not received any validation of the debt that Wakefield and their client XXXX XXXX claims that I owe. I am not disputing that this may ultimately be a valid debt at which point I will be happy to arrange a payment arrangement with Wakefield, however at this time I do not have enough to know if this is a correct balance. 

The collections agency has continued to peruse collection action after twice submitting a request for validation of the debt by continuing to contact me prior to validating the account. This is a clear violation of the FDCPA 15 USC 1692g ( b ) and is even more insulting as I gave them the courtesy of a second request for validation."

Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Unknown,"Santander Bank, NA holds a first mortgage on the single family home of my wife and I located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA. Loan number XXXX. Santander Bank, NA sent me 2 letters, dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, received by me this week, requesting that I obtain flood insurance or the bank will force place a flood insurance policy which will "" likely be more expensive and offer less protection '' than a policy I might privately obtain. In years past my single family house ( locus : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA. ) was in a special hazard zone, according to the FEMA map. But on XX/XX/XXXX, Case No. XXXX, FEMA issued a Letter of Map Amendment ( LOMA ) determining that my home ( "" the structure '' ) was not in the SFHA, removing the bank 's right to require flood insurance for my home. I notified Santander and provided them with a copy of the LOMA pertaining to my property. Upon information and belief, I also advise that my private flood insurance provider ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) also supplied notice, as required, to my mortgagee bank that it was canceling coverage and rebating a portion of my premium resulting from the application of the LOMA to my property. I did receive a rebate from the flood insurer. More significantly, by letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, and made part hereof by such reference, addressed to my wife, Santander acknowledged that since my property "" is no longer located in a Special Flood Hazard Area, it is no longer required that you maintain Flood ( sic ) insurance to cover the property. '' Santander sent two ( 2 ) of this same acknowledgement letter addressed to my wife, and none to me, and each of these letters references a second mortgage which was paid in full and discharged this year. Because of the LOMA, Santander made no flood insurance demand in XX/XX/XXXX. 
Upon review of Santander 's letters of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, received XX/XX/XXXX, I called the bank and was referred to "" customer/ service '' and had a conversation with an individual who would only identify herself as "" XXXX '' ( XXXX ). XXXX was very rude and curt and continually spoke over me as I tried to explain that I had no obligation to obtain flood insurance and that I objected to Santander 's threat to force place a flood insurance policy on my home. At first she claimed that my property was in a flood hazard zone, so I was required to obtain flood insurance. I kept trying to explain the LOMA and gave her the case number. She then changed her claim by saying that Santander had been notified by FEMA that the flood map had changed and that the LOMA no longer applied to my property. I asked her to provide me a copy of this alleged documentation from FEMA and she refused. She told me to contact FEMA and obtain this information myself. I said to her that I found it unusual that FEMA would provide the bank with notice of this alleged change, but not provide such notification to me. She then said that FEMA 's notification to Santander was verbal and acknowledged that the bank had not received anything in writing from FEMA to contradict the LOMA in effect. She reiterated that Santander 's position on the flood insurance requirement was firm and that if I had any "" problem '' with that, I should take it up with FEMA. 
I did call FEMA ( XXXX ) after speaking with "" XXXX '' from Santander. I gave XXXX at FEMA my LOMA case number and he checked and confirmed that there had been no map change since my LOMA was issued on XX/XX/XXXX, and that my LOMA was still in effect. 
Included and made part of this complaint by attachment and reference : ( 1 ) FEMA LOMA ; ( 2 ) Santander acknowledgment dated XX/XX/XXXX ; ( 3 ) Santander letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ; and ( 4 ) Santander letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

My complaint is that Santander Bank, NA either : ( 1 ) intentionally misrepresented my mortgage obligations vis a vis flood insurance in order to improperly obtain financial profit or gain for the bank or its agents, officers and/or employees to the economic detriment, emotional distress and physical injury of myself and my wife, or ( 2 )  negligently misrepresented my mortgage obligations vis a vis flood insurance to the economic detriment, emotional distress and physical injury of myself and my wife."

Their response was, "" Our system is programmed to facilitate a fair and accurate credit report review. Until you apply, we are unable to anticipate whether the resulting credit check will be a soft pull which does not impact your credit, or a hard pull which may impact your credit.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"PNC is actively reporting a line of credit as a defaulted and charged off mortgage to the credit bureaus. It is being classified as an M9 by the credit bureaus. After numerous attempts, there is no one individual at PNC who can navigate an issue from XXXX when PNC inherited the errors. 


I first spoke with Customer Service ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX @ XXXX ext. XXXX ) and said I had the Recorded instrument with the Satisfied Stamp to prove the equity line was paid off in XXXX. One individual told me they arent XXXX XXXX but PNC, not knowing of prior mergers. All were unable to help and did not call me back. 

My second attempt with an XXXX XXXX was unsuccessful so I contacted a local branch with a Mortgage Broker office. There I spoke with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. He informed me there was nothing that could be done and failed to provide any avenue to help resolve the error. 

Overview of error : With the many mergers ( XXXX became RBCXXXX XXXX then RBC Bank XXXX then PNC ) there was an error in the transitioning. 
The original credit line was opened with XXXX as an Equity Line for {$80000.00}. This was paid in full XXXX of XXXX. 
There is public documentation of RBCXXXX Certificate of Satisfaction for the Equity Line, paid in XX/XX/XXXX with the Register of Deeds ; with the merger of the two banks this has been overlooked by PNC. 
There is public documentation of the property used to secure the Equity Line being sold and transferred free of liens to the new owners XX/XX/XXXX. 
The account was then converted to an open line of credit, paid in full XX/XX/XXXX. 
We have not, nor ever have defaulted on a mortgage or credit line. 

We have documents showing a clear paper trail that begins with an equity line secured with property, a filed note of satisfaction from the payoff, a bank statement showing a zero balance and a clean transfer of ownership to the new owners, all ending in XX/XX/XXXX. 

The current RBC/PNC reporting to the credit bureaus needs to be changed from a charged off mortgage to a paid in full line of credit from XX/XX/XXXX up to the payoff in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Because of the age of these transactions, we were not aware of the reporting code M9. We had no need to apply for credit until we were refinancing our home in XXXX of XXXX, which was when we were informed how detrimental this error was to our credit report. In the end, it cost us points on our new mortgage and have probably had poor credit scores due to our supposed default of a mortgage."

Debt collection,Payday loan debt,Communication tactics,Frequent or repeated calls,"Hello The reason for initiating this complaint occurred today, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a call from a person named XXXX ( I dont know his last name ). He said he is the branch manager at the branch ( the branch # is XXXX ). 

Some background : I first got my loan I believe was XXXX of XXXX. I made every payment on time up until XX/XX/XXXX. I ran into financial distress due to excessive obligations ( too many loans ). 

In these last few months since XXXX, as I would get collection calls for being behind, I would speak to this same person, XXXX, and Ive spoken to a gentleman named XXXX. I would ask for hardship options, but was told only temporary options such as a deferment was available, where I paid roughly half of my normal loan payment. This option was available through XXXX of XXXX. 

In XXXX of XXXX, the deferment option was no longer available. The only temporary option available was a loan modification for two months. My payment amount was reduced to $ XXXX for two months. I signed up for this in XXXX. Unfortunately I have not been able to keep up with that. 

Which brings me to today, XX/XX/XXXX and my conversation tonight with branch manager XXXX. First off I felt he was very pushy and somewhat rude in how he approached the conversation. I didnt feel any respect or a willingness to have a civil conversation. A phrase he said several times Its not our job to call customers to collect from them, our job is to lend money. To me, this is poor customer service. 

There was one point in this conversation that really pushed me to file this complaint. At one point XXXX asked where are we failing you as a company, and I tried to answer that question. Two ways : 1 ). There is no documenting of conversations. In these last 7 months, as noted Ive had multiple conversations ( each month ) explaining why Im behind, why Im having difficulty making payments etc. This is frustrating. I feel I shouldnt have to explain myself every month. That it would be helpful that someone calling me has reference points of previous conversations. Especially in a conversation like tonight where Im being harassed and I can not point to any documentation of previous calls.

2 ). A longterm hardship option. As mentioned previously, in the last 7 months the only options made available to me were temporary. I did my part, made the necessary payment ( except of course in XXXX when I didnt ), but the relief was only monthly and to keep me current rather than a longterm, affordable hardship that will work to pay off this debt. 

When I detailed these two points to XXXX question, he provided no constructive thoughts or answers, but continued to harass me on why I hadnt made a payment since XXXX and that I have to make a payment by the end of XXXX. Comments such as this are not constructive, they are rude and unprofessional, especially to a customer that made on time payments for over 3 years. I became upset and told him I felt he was rude, and I didnt want to speak to him again. My apologies for losing my cool."

After about a XXXX minute conversation, I supplied the necessary information for the application and was told I would be contacted shortly. Nearly XXXX days later, I contacted the bank to check the status since I never received a a response and was told I had no application. After some searching, the rep located my original application but it was never submitted as complete so I had to complete the application from the beginning. After this I was told I would receive documents to sign in the mail. After a couple weeks with no documents, I contacted Navy Federal Credit Union and was told my window to sign had expired. They sent electronic signatures but never notified me. After requesting new documents sent they still never arrived. I ended up signing electronic documents after requesting a third time. In XXXX of XXXX after not hearing any news and not being able to contact my mortgage processor, I was finally informed I was transfered to a new processor. This involved re-verifying all my in refinance. In XXXX of XXXX I supplied XXXX 's, bank statements and credit reports for myself and my XXXX. A few weeks later I received the first documents to review but the information such as interest rates was not what was promised. I sent it back and informed of the correct information. XXXX I received another electronic form, this time with the correct information and promptly returned it completed. After another couple weeks with no contact I was finally informed that my documents containing sensitive information had expired and would need more current versions. Most important of those being a XXXX  credit history report and moving my closing date yet again. Upon speaking to a supervisor, we agreed on a lower rate for my troubles. Once again, the incorrect information was used and needed correcting. Now, XXXX  days until the projected closing, Navy Federal Credit Union is requesting a XXXX credit check and possibly moving the date due to their negligence. Any attempt to contact my processor is met with resistance and leaving a message generates more excuses than it does responses.

Given the well-documented history of Ocwen and legal actions taken by states against Ocwen for their improper home foreclosures ( legal actions which XXXX XXXX is working to enforce ), my first presumption was that Ocwen is trying to position themselves to do something improper on my mortgage -- like claim a failure on my part to respond to issues they will trump up and document in the future. 

Can you please advise me on what I can / should do to deal with Ocwen? 

Thank you for your consideration."

I hung up and he proceeded to call me 6 more times, each time telling him not to call. I then blocked his number then he proceeded to call with other numbers. I advised him i was reporting him for harassment. Then he started to call my work number I made the same statement. He called back again and asked for my supervisor I said not then he said please transfer me to HR i said no, and stop calling my work number. He continued to call a 3 more times. 

He also called my ex husband and left a voice mail for him. I do have the voicemail as he forwarded it to me. He called him after I repeatedly asked him to for communication to only be through them mail. This VM states they have time sensitive information regarding my personal information. 

Calling me at least 10 times in a 20 min span after asking him to stop each time is harassment. Calling my job and requesting HR and my supervisor is an attempt to intimidate me to give them information."

I received a letter in the mail at the end of XXXX with a statement dated "" XX/XX/XXXX '' stating that we owed {$110.00} for my son 's XXXX XXXX after insurance had reviewed and processed the claim. 
I had questions regarding insurance input so when clarified, I followed the online link that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX provided on the bill to pay the bill. The balance stated {$0.00} dollars. 
I reviewed bank statements and credit card statements to see if this was on autopay or if my husband paid it. Ultimately on XXXX I emailed to query what was owed and left my email and cell phone. At this time, on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating the account was sent to collections on XX/XX/XXXX after ONE attempt to collect their payment by mail- non registered. They sent the account to collections after 9 weeks without confirming that I had even received the bill ( which I had not until 4 weeks prior ). They have ALL my information including my cell and did not call or send out a second/warning bill. When I contacted them on XXXX and enquired about the bill as I was attempting to pay it the response was "" it has gone to collections '' with no alternative for me to resolve the issue but to wait for collections letter which I did. It arrived on XX/XX/XXXX and has been paid. 
To my mind, this is unfair and inappropriate- they made zero effort to collect the debt and zero effort to offer me a way to pay when I reached out. 
This is coming after this same group attempted to bill me twice for services rendered for my own XXXX work."

The bills were forwarded to HER home in N.C. and she was paying them. Around XX/XX/XXXX, my daughter purchased a 2 YEAR contract w/an XXXX. I was contacted when she wanted to purchase the XXXX and I told XXXX I was no longer the owner of the account again.

They said they fix it and again I thought they 'd figure it out. I confirmed with my daughter that she was paying her bill because I continued to get bills saying my account was over due, but she assured me she was paying, so I ignored it, and figured we were just being double billed. Finally in XX/XX/XXXX I received a collection notice, when I called I was told it was for an XXXX. It turns out that XXXX was billing me for her XXXX and billing my daughter only for phone service. They were trying to hold me accountable for her purchasing the phone but were billing her for the monthly service. I called several times with my contract showing I never authorized anyone other than myself to purchase or use my account. While this point is moot as I cancelled my account in XX/XX/XXXX. There are numerous calls from me cancelling the account, and my daughter opening an account. The account my daughter opened was a special account that allowed for a two year contract with the purchase of an iphone. XXXX used my credit to give her an XXXX.

I refinanced my FHA mortgage to a conventional mortgage with Citizens Bank. Their sales pitch was that it would save me {$200.00} a month. This was an escrowed mortgage. When I got my school taxes in the mail, I called to make sure they were paid. They were not. They were on file, but for some reason never paid. Also, when they sent me an escrow refund or whatever, they overpaid me back with no explanation. I called them and they said they didn't know what it is, but I should go ahead and cash it. Now my school taxes are late and they have a penalty. I am now short in my escrow account by over a XXXX dollars. I'll have to overfund it to make sure I have enough for real estate taxes. Their only answer to me ( after waiting on the phone for an hour in a half ) is that they also XXXX  up because they didn't collect enough money at closing. However, this was a no money down at closing loan! They rolled in the costs to the loan. Now I am concerned that my {$200.00} savings as promised is not {$200.00} and my mortgage balance has gone up by thousands! This was a bait and switch and had multiple mistakes."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"Hello, I am writing to dispute the reporting of my account with XXXXl XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account number : XXXX ) on my credit report. I believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated several provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 

According to my credit reports from XXXX and XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX reported that I was 30 days late on my payments in XX/XX/XXXX, even though I did not miss any payments on this account. Additionally, XXXX and XXXX are showing different balances for the same account, which is inconsistent and could lead to inaccurate credit scores. Moreover, the last reported date and the date last active are also inconsistent between the two credit reporting agencies. 

Based on the above details, I believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the following provisions of the FCRA : Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) - Incorrect information reported to credit reporting agencies Section 623 ( b ) - Duty to correct and update information Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) - Inconsistent reporting to credit reporting agencies Section 607 ( b ) - Time period for reporting outdated information Section 611 ( a ) - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy Furthermore, I believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has violated the following provisions of the TILA : Section 163 - Form of disclosure Section 166 - Administration of subchapter Section 167 - Civil liability The inaccurate reporting and inconsistencies have caused significant harm to my credit score and financial well-being. As a result, I have been denied credit opportunities and have had to pay higher interest rates and fees. This has caused me significant emotional and financial distress, making it difficult to obtain necessary loans and services. 

XXXX XXXX  regarding my account number XXXX. According to XXXX, XXXX XXXX reported that I was 30 days late on XX/XX/XXXX, when in fact I did not miss any payment on this account. This inaccurate reporting has had a significant impact on my life. 

As a result of this inaccurate reporting, I have been denied credit and have been subject to higher interest rates and fees. This has caused me a great deal of stress and financial hardship. I have been struggling to make ends meet and provide for my family, and the inaccurate reporting by XXXXXXXX XXXX has only made things worse. 

I believe that XXXXXXXX XXXX  has violated Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which requires furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies to provide accurate information. By reporting inaccurate information about my payment history, XXXXXXXX XXXX has not only caused me financial harm, but has also violated the law. 

XXXX XXXX. According to XXXX and XXXX, I was reported as 30 days late on my account number XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I did not miss any payment on this account. Additionally, XXXX has reported that the payment status is past due 60 days, but I never received any notification from them regarding this past due 60 days account, and they never provided any paperwork with me. Furthermore, XXXX is showing the last active date as XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX is showing it as XX/XX/XXXX. 

I believe that XXXX XXXX has violated several sections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). Specifically, I believe that XXXX XXXX has violated : Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA, which requires furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies to provide accurate information. By reporting that I was 30 days late on XX/XX/XXXX, when I did not miss any payment on that account, XXXX XXXX may have violated this section of the law. 

Section 623 ( b ) of the FCRA, which requires furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies to correct and update inaccurate or incomplete information. Since I did not miss any payment on my account, XXXX XXXX has provided inaccurate information that needs to be corrected. 

Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the FCRA, which prohibits furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies from reporting information that is not complete or that does not reflect the current status of the account. By reporting that my payment status is past due 60 days, without providing any notification or paperwork, XXXX XXXX may have violated this section of the law. 

Section 607 ( b ) of the FCRA, which requires credit reporting agencies to remove outdated information from credit reports. Since the last active date on my account is different between XXXX and XXXX, one of them may be reporting outdated information. 

Section 611 ( a ) of the FCRA, which requires credit reporting agencies to investigate disputes and correct inaccurate or incomplete information. I have disputed the inaccurate information that XXXX XXXX has reported, and I request that this be investigated and corrected. 

Section 163 of TILA, which requires lenders to provide consumers with accurate and meaningful disclosures. I believe that XXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with accurate information regarding my account. 

Section 166 of TILA, which sets forth the administration of the subchapter of the law. I believe that XXXX XXXX has not complied with the requirements of this section. 

Section 167 of TILA, which provides for civil liability for violations of the law. I believe that XXXX XXXX has violated several sections of TILA, and I may be entitled to civil remedies under this section. 

The inaccurate information that XXXX XXXX has reported on my credit report has had a significant impact on my life. I have been denied credit, and my credit score has suffered as a result of these errors. As a result, I have been unable to purchase a home for my family and have had to pay higher interest rates on loans and credit cards. 

XXXX XXXXXXXX on my credit report. Specifically, XXXX XXXX has reported that I was 120 days late on XX/XX/XXXX on my account number XXXX, when in fact I did not miss any payments on that account. Additionally, XXXX has reported that the payment status is past due 120 days, but I never received any notification from them regarding this past due account and they never provided any paperwork with me. 

I believe that XXXX XXXX has violated several sections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). The specific violations are as follows : Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA requires that furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies must provide accurate information. By reporting that I was 120 days late on XX/XX/XXXX, when in fact I did not miss any payments on that account, XXXX XXXX may have violated this section of the law. 

Section 623 ( b ) of the FCRA requires that furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies must correct and update any inaccurate information. As the information reported by XXXX XXXX is inaccurate, they have violated this section of the law. 

Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the FCRA requires that furnishers of information to credit reporting agencies must not report information that is inconsistent with the information they have provided to the consumer. As XXXX XXXX has reported information that is inconsistent with my payment history, they have violated this section of the law. 

Section 607 ( b ) of the FCRA requires that negative information, such as late payments, can only be reported for a specific time period. As the information reported by XXXX XXXX is outdated, they have violated this section of the law. 

Section 611 ( a ) of the FCRA requires that consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate information on their credit report. As I am disputing the accuracy of the information being reported by XXXX XXXX, they must investigate and correct any inaccurate information. 

Section 163 of the TILA requires that creditors must provide a clear and conspicuous disclosure of the terms and conditions of a credit account. XXXX XXXX may have violated this section of the law by not providing me with clear and conspicuous disclosures. 

Section XXXX of the XXXX requires that creditors must comply with the provisions of the subchapter, including providing accurate information to credit reporting agencies. As XXXX XXXX has reported inaccurate information to credit reporting agencies, they have violated this section of the law. 

Section 167 of the TILA provides for civil liability for creditors who violate the provisions of the subchapter. As XXXX XXXX may have violated several provisions of the TILA, they may be liable for civil damages. 

This inaccurate credit reporting has had a significant negative impact on my life. The false late payment and past due status has resulted in my credit score being lowered, which has made it difficult for me to obtain credit and loans at reasonable interest rates. This has prevented me from making important purchases and has caused me significant financial stress and hardship. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to XXXX, the payment status is listed as "" charge off, '' but I have never received any notification regarding this charge off account. Additionally, XXXX reported a high credit of {$5000.00}, but XXXX did not report any such information. Other bureaus also did not report any negative information on my account. 

I believe that XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX has violated the following laws : Section 607 ( b ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - Time period for reporting outdated information Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA - Incorrect information reported to credit reporting agencies Section 623 ( b ) of the FCRA - Duty to correct and update information The inaccurate reporting by XXXX XXXX XXXX has greatly affected my life. I have been denied credit and loans, and my interest rates have been significantly higher due to the negative information on my credit report. This has made it difficult for me to obtain basic necessities, such as a car or a home. 

I request that XXXX XXXX XXXX remove these unverified accounts from my credit report immediately. I urge you to enforce the legal violations committed by XXXX XXXX XXXX and take necessary action to prevent this from happening to other consumers. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

For this reason, I had the document notarized by XXXX CT. town hall. I immediately sent the document to the EOS CCA collection agency. I was explicit in instructing EOS CCA in the validation of debt letter to explain several key points. I asked for clarification about how the amount in question had arrived. I asked the agency to complete my request in a way in which I can understand. For good measure, I asked that EOS CCA prove that they're licensed in my state. The agency were requested to provide their license number to me. In the end, my letter instructed EOS CCA to ONLY contact me through the United States mail. On XX/XX/XXXX I received in the mail EOS CCA 's response to my validation of debt letter. I have enclosed the agency document for your review. Altogether, my requests were completely disregarded. In the final analysis, the response shows no details of how the alleged amount was calculated. The agency proceeded to ignore my request. EOS CCA contacted me XX/XX/XXXX through my cell phone number. They demanded my social security number in order to verify me which I was not comfortable giving them. The rep insisted there was no other way to verify me and as a result their was no just reason to respect the cease and desist?. In brief, my work number was never provided to them by myself and XXXX XXXX never had my work number. The representative made mention that in their notes they were well aware of my cease and desist. They still contacted me through my work/cell number after I stated only by mail. I have been given no reason to trust this agency especially with such personal information. All things considered, EOS CCA has violated my rights over and over again. Given these points, I am enlisting the help of CFPB that EOS CCA agency CEASE & DESIST immediately."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"In XXXX of 2022, I submitted disputes to XXXX, XXXX, and Experian about accounts listed on my consumer report as being inaccurate and false reporting. I clearly stated the law requires them to furnish accurate information on my credit report and to do a thorough investigation into the problem which was not done. Each time I disputed something on my credit report that I know was inaccurate they would come back within 7 days saying the information is verified ; I would never get any information on who verified it or who they spoke to absolutely nothing. Now the law clearly states the following : 15 USC 1681a 603 FCRA ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) EXCLUSION : except as provided in paragraph ( 3 ), the term consumer report does not include ( A ) subject to section 1681s3 of this title, any ( i ) report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report ; ( B ) any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device ; Credit Card : The term credit card means any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit. 

Social Security Card or Drivers License are considered credit cards under the TILA definition of a credit card for which they both were used to obtain credit and by law is excluded from being reported. 

Just by this section alone none of the accounts on my consumer report should be there but they are and that is a violation. The practices and procedures used by the credit reporting agencies are unfair and unjust to me as the consumer. Their investigation process is flawed and unfair and is damaging to me the consumer."
